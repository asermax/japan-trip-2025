# Detailed Location Research Command

This command conducts comprehensive detailed research on locations identified during discovery, deploying multiple Location Researcher Agents in parallel based on the research assignments from the discovery state file.

## Usage
```
/research [destination]
```

If no destination is provided, the command will automatically select the destination with the most recent discovery state file in `research/state/`.

## Prerequisites
- **Required**: Discovery must be completed
- **Required**: Discovery state file must exist: `research/state/{destination-slug}-discovery-state.md`
- **State file must contain**: Research assignments and priority locations in todo format

## Process Overview

### 1. Validation & Setup
1. **Destination Selection**:
   - **With argument**: Use provided destination and locate corresponding state file
   - **Without argument**: Find most recent `*-discovery-state.md` file in `research/state/`

2. **State File Validation**:
   - Verify discovery state file exists
   - **If missing**: Alert user and stop execution with message:
     ```
     ‚ùå Error: No discovery state file found for {destination}.
     Please run /discovery {destination} first to complete the discovery phase.
     ```
   - Parse state file for research assignments and context

3. **Extract Context from State File**:
   - Visit dates and accommodation details
   - TODO list organized by category
   - Cultural research topics and seasonal considerations
   - Date-specific events and festivals

### 2. Simplified Batch Processing with File Updates

Process research using predefined 5-agent batches with **immediate file creation/updates after each batch**:

**Batch Processing Strategy:**
- **Automatic Batch Creation**: Research command automatically divides TODO list items across 5-agent batches
- **Category-Based Selection**: Pick items from high-priority categories first (Cultural/Historic, Natural/Scenic, Traditional) then other categories
- **Batch Size**: Each batch contains up to 5 locations assigned to 5 agents running in parallel
- **Sequential Batches**: Complete one batch before starting the next

**File Update Points:**
- After each batch completion, immediately create/update destination and attraction files
- Update state file with batch completion status and findings
- Maintain continuous availability of research progress

**Per-Agent Context Package:**
```
Research comprehensive information for your assigned locations in: {DESTINATION}

Visit Period: {VISIT_DATES} (for seasonal context and events reference)
Duration: {STAY_DURATION} (for planning context only)
Accommodation: {ACCOMMODATION_NAME} - {ACCOMMODATION_ADDRESS}

RESEARCH PURPOSE: Complete cataloging of all information about each assigned location.
This is NOT about fitting into a specific itinerary - research and document everything useful.

{PRACTICAL_CONSIDERATIONS}

## Research Focus Areas

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: Research each location as a SEPARATE ATTRACTION FILE. Every specific place to visit, dining experience, district exploration, or activity gets its own detailed file.

For each assigned location, research:

### Destination Summary Creation
- **Brief overview only** (2-3 paragraphs total for entire destination)
- Cultural significance and timing context
- One-sentence summaries for districts, food culture, day trips
- **NO detailed information** in destination file

### Individual Attraction Research (DETAILED)
For EVERY specific location discovered:

**Practical Information**
- Complete operating hours and seasonal schedules
- Full admission costs and booking requirements
- Detailed accessibility and transportation options
- Current operational status and any restrictions
- Optimal visiting times and crowd management strategies

**Cultural Context & Experience**
- Comprehensive cultural significance and historical background
- Complete visitor experience expectations
- Photography guidelines and cultural restrictions
- Detailed cultural etiquette and proper behavior protocols
- Local customs, traditions, and cultural preparation

**Visitor Experience**
- Recent visitor reviews and comprehensive experience reports
- Detailed duration recommendations and time considerations
- What makes this location special, unique, and worth visiting
- Connections with nearby locations and integration opportunities
- Comprehensive practical tips for international visitors

## Research Instructions
- **SEPARATE FILES**: Create individual attraction files for EVERY specific location, restaurant, district area, day trip, activity
- Use multiple research tools in parallel when possible
- Verify information across multiple sources
- **SOURCE CITATION**: Include inline source references immediately after relevant content
- **CITATION FORMAT**: Use `*Source: [Description](URL) - Accessed Date*` format
- **PHOTO REQUIREMENTS**: Include at least one representative photo for each destination and attraction file using markdown format `![Alt text](image_url)`
- **LOCATION PINS**: Add Google Maps location link at the end of each file: `**Location:** [View on Google Maps](google_maps_url)`
- **PHOTO SOURCING**: Search for official tourism photos, Wikipedia commons, or other freely available images that represent the location
- Note seasonal considerations and optimal visiting conditions
- Cross-reference with cultural context from discovery phase
- Document all available information regardless of trip duration constraints
- Use Gemini research for cultural deep-dives when needed
- **Destination file**: Only summary information, all details go to attraction files
- **CITATION PLACEMENT**: Source each practical detail, cultural claim, and recommendation separately

## Output Format

**Destination File**: Brief summary only with:
- **Representative photo** of the destination integrated into the content
- Cultural overview and significance (2-3 paragraphs) **with inline source citations**
- One-sentence district summaries **with source references**
- One-sentence food culture overview **with cultural source attribution**

### 3. Automated Batch Execution & File Management

**Batch Creation Logic:**
1. **Parse TODO List**: Extract all `- [ ]` items from state file by category
2. **Category Order**: Process categories in the order they appear in the state file
3. **Sequential Selection**: Pick items from first category, then second category, etc., maintaining state file order within each category
4. **Agent Assignment**: Assign up to 5 locations per batch to 5 agents running in parallel
5. **Batch Sequence**: Complete each batch fully before starting the next

**Per-Batch Execution:**
1. **Deploy Agents**: Launch 5 Location Researcher Agents with current batch assignments
2. **Process Results**: Compile findings from completed agents
3. **Update Files**:
   - Create/update destination summary file: `research/destinations/{destination-slug}.md`
   - Create/update attractions directory: `research/attractions/{destination-slug}/`
   - Create/update attraction files for current batch locations
4. **Update State**: Mark batch locations as completed `[x]` in state file
5. **Checkpoint**: Confirm files created/updated and available for use

**Integration Points (Applied Per Batch):**
- Cross-reference findings between related locations discovered in current and previous batches
- Identify timeline integration opportunities as information becomes available
- Note transportation connections and logical groupings emerging from research
- Highlight seasonal considerations specific to visit dates in each batch

### 4. Incremental File Management & Updates

**Per-Batch State File Updates:**
After each batch completion, update the state file to reflect progress:
```markdown
### {Category Name}
- [x] {Location name} - Research completed, attraction file created
- [x] {Location name} - Research completed, attraction file created
- [ ] {Location name} - Pending next batch research
```

**Incremental File Creation:**
Files are created and updated throughout the process:

**After Each Batch:**
1. **Update destination file:** `research/destinations/{destination-slug}.md` - Add any new context discovered
2. **Create/update attractions directory:** `research/attractions/{destination-slug}/`
3. **Create attraction files:** `research/attractions/{destination-slug}/{attraction-slug}.md` for each researched location
4. **Cross-reference updates:** Add connections discovered between current and previous batch locations
