# Detailed Location Research Command

This command conducts comprehensive detailed research on locations identified during discovery, deploying multiple Location Researcher Agents in parallel based on the research assignments from the discovery state file.

## Usage
```
/research [destination]
```

If no destination is provided, the command will automatically select the destination with the most recent discovery state file in `research/state/`.

## Prerequisites
- **Required**: Discovery must be completed
- **Required**: Discovery state file must exist: `research/state/{destination-slug}-discovery-state.md`
- **State file must contain**: Research assignments and priority locations in todo format

## Process Overview

### 1. Validation & Setup
1. **Destination Selection**:
   - **With argument**: Use provided destination and locate corresponding state file
   - **Without argument**: Find most recent `*-discovery-state.md` file in `research/state/`

2. **State File Validation**:
   - Verify discovery state file exists
   - **If missing**: Alert user and stop execution with message:
     ```
     ‚ùå Error: No discovery state file found for {destination}.
     Please run /discovery {destination} first to complete the discovery phase.
     ```
   - Parse state file for research assignments and context

3. **Extract Context from State File**:
   - Visit dates and accommodation details
   - Priority locations organized by tier
   - Cultural and contextual background
   - Research batch assignments
   - Date-specific events and festivals

### 2. Parallel Research Agent Deployment

Deploy **multiple Location Researcher Agents simultaneously** based on state file batch assignments:

**Agent Assignment Strategy:**
- **Batch 1**: Essential locations (Tier 1) - Deploy 2 agents in parallel
- **Batch 2**: Conditional locations (Tier 2) - Deploy 2 agents in parallel
- **Batch 3**: Backup options (Tier 3) - Deploy 1-2 agents based on list size

**Per-Agent Context Package:**
```
Research comprehensive information for your assigned locations in: {DESTINATION}

Visit Period: {VISIT_DATES} (for seasonal context and events reference)
Duration: {STAY_DURATION} (for planning context only)
Accommodation: {ACCOMMODATION_NAME} - {ACCOMMODATION_ADDRESS}

RESEARCH PURPOSE: Complete cataloging of all information about each assigned location.
This is NOT about fitting into a specific itinerary - research and document everything useful.

## Your Research Assignment
{SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS_FROM_BATCH}

## Background Context (from Discovery)
{CULTURAL_CONTEXT_FROM_STATE_FILE}
{DATE_SPECIFIC_EVENTS}
{INFORMATION_SOURCES_DISCOVERED}

## Research Focus Areas

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: Research each location as a SEPARATE ATTRACTION FILE. Every specific place to visit, dining experience, district exploration, or activity gets its own detailed file.

For each assigned location, research:

### Destination Summary Creation
- **Brief overview only** (2-3 paragraphs total for entire destination)
- Cultural significance and timing context
- One-sentence summaries for districts, food culture, day trips
- **NO detailed information** in destination file

### Individual Attraction Research (DETAILED)
For EVERY specific location discovered:

**Practical Information**
- Complete operating hours and seasonal schedules
- Full admission costs and booking requirements
- Detailed accessibility and transportation options
- Current operational status and any restrictions
- Optimal visiting times and crowd management strategies

**Cultural Context & Experience**
- Comprehensive cultural significance and historical background
- Complete visitor experience expectations
- Photography guidelines and cultural restrictions
- Detailed cultural etiquette and proper behavior protocols
- Local customs, traditions, and cultural preparation

**Visitor Experience**
- Recent visitor reviews and comprehensive experience reports
- Detailed duration recommendations and time considerations
- What makes this location special, unique, and worth visiting
- Connections with nearby locations and integration opportunities
- Comprehensive practical tips for international visitors

## Research Instructions
