# Location Discovery Command

This command initiates the parallel discovery phase for a Japan trip destination, deploying both Location Scavenger and Location Discovery (gemini-based) agents to comprehensively identify information sources, attractions, and related locations.

## Usage
```
/discovery [destination]
```

If no destination is provided, the command will automatically select the next research-needed destination from `research/destinations-todo.md`.

## Process Overview

### 1. Destination Selection
- **With argument**: Use the provided destination name
- **Without argument**: Parse `research/destinations-todo.md` and select the first destination with status "‚è≥ Research needed" or "üîç Research in progress"
- Extract accommodation details, visit dates, and duration from the TODO file

### 2. Parallel Agent Deployment
Deploy **both agents simultaneously** with identical location prompts:

**Location Scavenger Agent:**
- Uses WebSearch and trusted resources for practical discovery
- Identifies official tourism sources and travel guides
- Searches for seasonal/date-specific events during visit period
- Cross-references existing recommendations from base itinerary
- Focuses on accessibility and practical visitor information

**Location Discovery Agent (Gemini-based):**
- Uses gemini research capabilities for cultural context
- Discovers authentic local perspectives and traditional significance
- Researches historical background and regional specialties
- Identifies cultural events and traditional practices
- Provides deeper cultural context beyond tourist information

### 3. Agent Instructions Template

**Common Context for Both Agents:**
```
Research comprehensive information for: {DESTINATION}

Visit Period: {VISIT_DATES}
Duration: {STAY_DURATION}
Accommodation: {ACCOMMODATION_NAME} - {ACCOMMODATION_ADDRESS}

RESEARCH PURPOSE: Comprehensive cataloging of ALL available options, attractions, and experiences.
This is NOT itinerary planning - discover and document everything worth knowing for later reference.

Your task is to discover and catalog:
1. Information sources (official tourism, travel guides, community resources)
2. ALL locations, attractions, and experiences (regardless of visit duration constraints)
3. Date-specific events, festivals, or seasonal considerations for reference
4. Cultural context and significance of all discovered options
5. Related nearby locations and regional attractions worth documenting

Focus on building a complete catalog of possibilities for comprehensive research.
```

**Location Scavenger Agent Additional Instructions:**
- Use WebSearch and trusted resources from `research/trusted-resources.md`
- Prioritize official sources and established travel publications
- Identify practical visitor information and current operational status
- Search for events and festivals during the specific visit period
- Cross-reference against existing base recommendations

**Location Discovery Agent Additional Instructions:**
- Use gemini research capabilities for cultural deep-dive
- Focus on authentic local perspectives and traditional significance
- Research historical context and regional specialties
- Identify cultural practices and their modern adaptations
- Provide traditional context beyond typical tourist information

### 4. Results Compilation
After both agents complete their research:

1. **Merge findings** from both agents into unified comprehensive state
2. **Eliminate source differentiation** - present integrated findings
3. **Create unified catalog list** using todo markdown format:
   ```markdown
   ## Priority Locations for Research

   ### Tier 1 - Essential
   - [ ] {Location name} - {Brief description and significance}

   ### Tier 2 - Conditional
   - [ ] {Location name} - {Context and considerations for visiting}

   ### Tier 3 - Backup Options
   - [ ] {Location name} - {Alternative experiences and context}
   ```

### 5. State File Generation
Create state file: `research/state/{destination-slug}-discovery-state.md`

**Required State File Structure:**
```markdown
# {Destination} - Discovery State

**Date:** {Creation date}
**Visit Period:** {Visit dates}
**Accommodation:** {Accommodation name and address}
**Status:** Discovery completed

## Comprehensive Research Findings

### Information Sources Discovered
- **Official Resources:** {Count and key sources}
- **Travel Guides:** {Major coverage found}
- **Community Resources:** {Forum/social platforms}
- **Media Resources:** {Video/photo content}

### Cultural and Contextual Information
- **Cultural Significance:** {Key insights and context}
- **Local Perspectives:** {Authentic experiences}
- **Historical Background:** {Relevant context}
- **Regional Specialties:** {Local customs and traditions}

## Priority Locations for Research

### Tier 1 - Essential
- [ ] {Location name} - {Brief description and significance}

### Tier 2 - Conditional
- [ ] {Location name} - {Conditions for inclusion and context}

### Tier 3 - Backup Options
- [ ] {Location name} - {Alternative option context and considerations}

## Date-Specific Events

### {Event/Festival name}
- **Period:** {Duration}
- **Locations:** {Where it occurs}
- **Features:** {What to expect}
- **Cultural Context:** {Significance and background}

## Research Assignments for Detailed Research

### Batch 1 - Priority Locations
- Agent A: [Essential locations with context]
- Agent B: [Essential locations with context]

### Batch 2 - Conditional Research
- Agent C: [Conditional locations with context]
- Agent D: [Conditional locations with context]

## Follow-up Research Topics for Detailed Phase
- {Topic identified from comprehensive research findings}
```

### 6. Update TODO Status
Update the destination status in `research/destinations-todo.md`:
- Change from "‚è≥ Research needed" to "üîç Research in progress"
- Add reference to state file created

## Success Criteria
- Both agents complete discovery research
- State file created with unified findings
- Priority locations organized in todo format for phase 2
- Research assignments defined for parallel detailed research
- TODO file updated with progress status

## Output
The command should conclude with:
1. Summary of locations discovered and prioritized
2. Path to generated state file
3. Confirmation that destination is ready for Phase 2 research
4. Next recommended command: `/research {destination}`
