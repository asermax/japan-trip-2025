Beppu is Japan's premier hot spring resort city, producing the largest volume of thermal water in the country with over 2,000 hot springs generating approximately 50,000 tons of water daily. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/713/) The city's identity centers on its eight distinct onsen districts (Beppu Hattō), each with unique water qualities and characteristics. The Kannawa Onsen district represents the cultural and historical heart of Beppu's geothermal heritage, featuring the famous Seven Hells (Jigoku Meguri) and traditional jigoku-mushi steam cooking.

The "hells" (jigoku) have over 1,200 years of documented history, appearing in the eighth-century Bungo Fudoki as feared volcanic sites. Buddhist monk Ippen Shonin's legendary 13th-century intervention transformed these "cursed" lands into healing spaces, establishing the foundation for Beppu's evolution from samurai health recovery destination to modern resort city.
