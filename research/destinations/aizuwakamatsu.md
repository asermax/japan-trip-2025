Aizuwakamatsu is a historic samurai town in Fukushima Prefecture, approximately 3-3.5 hours from Tokyo by train. The city embodies one of Japan's most profound symbols of samurai loyalty and tragic sacrifice, shaped indelibly by the Boshin War (1868-1869). When the Aizu Domain refused to abandon its sacred oath of absolute loyalty to the Tokugawa shogunate, it faced devastating military defeat and harsh post-war treatment that branded it as an "enemy of the court."

The domain's identity was forged by its founder, Hoshina Masayuki, who established the Aizu House Code with Article 1 stating unequivocally: "Be Faithful to Tokugawa." This precept transformed political allegiance into a moral and almost religious obligation, creating an identity where loyalty to the Tokugawa was inseparable from honor itself. [ðŸ”—](https://jhistories.com/tsurugajo-castle/) The city's narrative of unwavering loyalty, resilience in the face of overwhelming odds, and the transformation of defeat into cultural pride creates a unique regional identity that endures today.

The city centers on Tsuruga Castle with its distinctive red-tiled roof and the sacred Iimoriyama Hill where the Byakkotai tragedy occurred.

The region's prestigious sake brewing traditions produce nationally-acclaimed sake with Fukushima winning more national gold awards than any other prefecture.
