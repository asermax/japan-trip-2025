Kumamoto stands as one of Japan's most historically significant cities, defined by its legendary castle and the enduring legacy of Kato Kiyomasa, the brilliant samurai lord who transformed this region into a cultural and engineering marvel. The city's identity revolves around "Seishoko-san" (Lord Seisho), as residents affectionately call Kiyomasa, whose unmatched castle-building genius and civil engineering achievements brought prosperity to the region in the early 17th century.

The city experienced devastating earthquakes in 2016, with Kumamoto Castle sustaining extensive damage. The ongoing restoration efforts have become part of the city's modern narrative, demonstrating regional resilience and commitment to heritage preservation. The main castle keep fully reopened in 2021, though comprehensive restoration continues through 2052. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/season/detail/94)

Beyond samurai heritage, Kumamoto offers access to Japan's most dramatic volcanic landscapes at Mount Aso, traditional hot spring towns like Kurokawa Onsen, and unique culinary traditions including basashi (horse meat sashimi) introduced by Kato Kiyomasa. November visitors enjoy optimal conditions for autumn foliage viewing, particularly the famous ginkgo trees that earned Kumamoto Castle its nickname "Ginkgo Castle."
