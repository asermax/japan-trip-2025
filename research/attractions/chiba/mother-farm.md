Mother Farm represents one of Japan's most significant agricultural tourism destinations, embodying the cultural evolution of Japanese agritourism since its establishment in 1962. [🔗](https://www.motherfarm.co.jp.e.apt.hp.transer.com/about/outline.php) The farm's origin story reflects deep Japanese values - founder Hisakichi Maeda (founder of Sankei Shimbun newspaper and Tokyo Tower) named it to honor his mother, who grew up in poverty in prewar rural Osaka and often said "if only we had one more cow, we could prosper." [🔗](https://japan.stripes.com/travel/mother-farm-chiba.html) This personal history transformed into a 250-hectare vision to bring nature and agriculture to urban Japanese families.

Located on Mt. Kanozan within Minami Boso Quasi-National Park, the farm offers panoramic views of the Boso Peninsula mountains, Tokyo Bay, and Mt. Fuji. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/335/) As one of Japan's leading facilities for agricultural education and entertainment, Mother Farm bridges the urban-rural divide, offering city dwellers - especially children - direct contact with farming heritage that forms the foundation of Japanese culture.

## Important Notes

### Critical Transportation Warning
**The farm bus schedule is very limited.** Missing the last bus means waiting over an hour or more. Upon arrival, immediately check return bus times and plan your departure around the last available bus. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021259-d1238574-Reviews-Mother_Farm-Futtsu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html) This is the single most important practical consideration for public transit visitors.

### Weather Preparation
November mountain weather can be significantly colder than Tokyo with constant strong winds. Multiple visitors emphasize the need for warm clothing and wind protection, even on days without precipitation. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021259-d1238574-Reviews-Mother_Farm-Futtsu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

### Time Allocation
The 250-hectare farm requires extensive walking with attractions spread widely. A full day is necessary to experience main shows and activities without rushing. Factor in 4-5 hours total travel time for day trips from Tokyo. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021259-d1238574-Reviews-Mother_Farm-Futtsu_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

### Show Schedules
Show times vary and aren't fixed - check the regularly updated timetable on the official website before visiting or inquire upon arrival to plan your route through the farm efficiently.
