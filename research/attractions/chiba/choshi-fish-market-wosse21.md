Wosse 21 (ウオッセ21, also written as Uosse 21) is a marine products sales center adjacent to the Choshi Port Tower, serving as a sightseeing base for Choshi Fishing Port in Chiba Prefecture. The facility combines the concept of "seeing, buying, and eating" the sea and fish of Choshi, functioning as a cross between a traditional fish market and a food court. Located at Japan's premier fishing port, which has held the top position nationally for catch volume for 12 consecutive years, Wosse 21 offers visitors an authentic, working-port experience with fresh-off-the-boat seafood, including the renowned kinmedai (golden eye snapper) specialty of the region. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-12800037/)

Choshi's fishing heritage dates back centuries, with the city's strategic location at the mouth of the Tone River establishing it as a vital commercial port during the Edo Period (1603-1868). [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/tokyo/attractions-and-excursions/choshi-chiba-guide-discover-the-charm-of-this-coastal-city) The city rose to prominence through two main industries that have shaped its identity for over 400 years: fishing and soy sauce production. [🔗](https://donnykimball.com/choshi-a9e8423f121b)

Wosse 21 embodies Choshi's maritime legacy as a working market where visitors can experience the authentic atmosphere of Japan's most productive fishing port. The facility opened as a companion to the 57.7-meter tall Choshi Port Tower, which was completed in 1991 to provide panoramic views of fishing boats, the Pacific Ocean, and the expansive port area. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1545/)

The market features a seafood sales center on the ground floor where fish landed at Choshi Port that day are displayed, alongside various local products including kamaboko (fish paste cakes), senbei (rice crackers), and locally produced soy sauce. On the second floor, the 160-seat Seafood Restaurant Wosse (Uoze) serves fresh catches prepared as sashimi, simmered dishes, and the signature seafood rice bowls (zuke-don) featuring the region's prized kinmedai.

## Cultural & Maritime Heritage

Unlike Tokyo's massive Toyosu Market, which handles seafood from across Japan and around the world, Wosse 21 provides a more intimate, authentic experience focused on Choshi's local catch. While Toyosu is a highly organized wholesale facility with structured tourist viewing areas, Wosse 21 maintains the atmosphere of a traditional working port where visitors can get closer to the fishing industry's daily operations. The market's scale is smaller but more accessible, with vendors who interact directly with customers in a lively, fast-paced environment.

**Fishing Heritage Foundation:**

The Boso Peninsula's fishing culture extends back over 1,000 years, with archaeological fishing implements found dating 2,000-5,000 years. [🔗](https://factsanddetails.com/japan/cat24/sub159/item934.html) During the Edo period (1603-1868), Tokugawa Ieyasu brought fishermen from Kansai with superior techniques, transforming the region. In 1656, Sakiyama Jiroemon from Kii Province introduced makaseami sardine-fishing methods and established Tokawa Fishing Harbor in 1661, creating a major regional fishing center. [🔗](https://uj-tours.com/tokawa-fishing-village/)

By the mid-Edo Period, Kujukuri's sardine catch represented one-third of Japan's national production. [🔗](https://www.obayashi.co.jp/en/kikan_obayashi/detail/kikan_63_column01_2.html) Traditional seine fishing employed approximately 200 coordinated workers hauling nets onto beaches, fostering strong community bonds and spiritual practices. Fishermen sang labor songs and big-fishing celebration songs (designated as prefectural intangible folk cultural asset in 1965), creating rich oral traditions documenting fishing life. [🔗](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/3855)

The Boso Peninsula's coastal area near Choshi has a large continental shelf with a depth of 200m, where the Kuroshio and Oyashio ocean currents combine with the outflow of the Tone River to create abundant fishing grounds. [🔗](https://japan-word.com/en/sangayaki) This geographic advantage has sustained Choshi's fishing industry for centuries and made it Japan's premier fishing port. Today, Choshi Port maintains its position with annual catches of 200,000-300,000 tons of fish and over 200 species caught. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/chiba/getting-to-know-choshi-s-seafood-heritage/71018)

**Community Spiritual Traditions:**

Namikiri Fudoson Temple has been worshipped as a guardian god of the sea since the Genroku period (1688-1704), when lights from the main hall guided a drifting fishing boat to safety. [🔗](https://visitminamiboso.wordpress.com/about-the-boso/) Ohara Hadaka Matsuri (Naked Man Festival), founded during the Jōgan era (859-877 CE), has been held for over four centuries to pray for plentiful fish catches and abundant harvests, featuring the distinctive shiofumi ceremony where sacred palanquins are carried into the sea by local men. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadaka_Matsuri)

## Regional Specialty: Kinmedai (Golden Eye Snapper)

Choshi's most celebrated fish is the **kinmedai** (Beryx splendens), branded as "Choshi-tsuri-kinme" (line-caught kinmedai from Choshi). This deep-sea fish is prized for its tender, fatty white flesh and vibrant red skin. The region's kinmedai is caught using a vertical longline method, with each fish caught individually to minimize stress and damage, preserving its exceptional quality. This sustainable fishing method reflects Choshi's deep respect for marine resources and contrasts sharply with mass-trawling techniques.

**Traditional Preparations:**
- **Nitsuke:** Whole fish simmered in soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar - the most iconic preparation that enhances the fish's natural sweetness and rich flavor
- **Sashimi:** Raw, often lightly seared (aburi) to bring out the flavor
- **Donburi:** Sliced raw or simmered kinmedai served over rice (zuke-don)
- **Shioyaki:** Simply grilled with salt to highlight natural oils
- **Tempura:** Delicate flesh deep-fried in light batter

The kinmedai fishery is carefully regulated with restrictions on fishing times and minimum size requirements, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the population.

## November Seasonal Considerations

- **Transitional Period:** November marks the shift from autumn to winter fishing seasons
- **Winter Specialties Emerging:** Gurnard ("Choshi offing gurnard") begins its season in late November through March [🔗](https://tabimaniajapan.com/culture/food-culture/japans-seasonal-seafood-calendar-best-times-to-enjoy-eating-fish)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Market Etiquette & Customs

**Working Environment Respect:**

Wosse 21 is specifically designed as a tourist sightseeing base with the concept of "seeing, buying, and eating," making it more accessible than professional wholesale markets. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-12800037/) However, it remains a working marketplace where vendors conduct daily business with local customers. Be aware of your surroundings at this working marketplace, as you don't want to impede locals from shopping. [🔗](https://alljapantours.com/japan/food-and-drinks/where-to-eat/Visiting-the-Tsukiji-Fish-Market/) Don't touch anything, keep a relatively low profile, and generally just play nicely. [🔗](https://expertphotography.com/photography-etiquette-in-japan/)

**Vendor Interaction:**
Most shops do not speak English but are very friendly and reasonably priced. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html) The atmosphere is less touristy than Tokyo's major markets, providing a more authentic local experience. Show genuine interest rather than treating the market as purely entertainment - remember you are a visitor being allowed to be there out of kindness, not duty. [🔗](https://expertphotography.com/photography-etiquette-in-japan/)

**Photography Etiquette:**
Always ask for permission before photographing goods or people - even if you don't speak Japanese and they don't speak English, sign language usually works. [🔗](https://medium.com/kokoro-media/public-photography-in-japan-laws-rules-and-etiquette-3fc08ba87b21) Asking is not only suggested, but it's good photography etiquette. [🔗](https://martinbaileyphotography.com/2012/04/16/podcast-331-tsukiji-fish-market/) Japanese fish markets generally prohibit flash photography during working operations, as it can interfere with business and startle workers. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k2495709-Tsukiji_Fish_Market_rules_no_flash_no_small_children_pls-Japan.html) Take photos of food but avoid capturing surrounding diners and staff; not everyone will want to be in your shot. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/responsible-travel-guide/features/responsible-photography/)

**Practical Considerations:**
Leave suitcases or large backpacks at your hotel or in a station locker to navigate comfortably. [🔗](https://alljapantours.com/japan/food-and-drinks/where-to-eat/Visiting-the-Tsukiji-Fish-Market/) Wosse 21 offers free parking for 100 vehicles, making it accessible for day trips. Keep strong perfumes and heavily scented cosmetics to a minimum because they can interfere with the delicate evaluation of fresh seafood. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/)

### Purchasing Customs

**Kinmedai Quality Selection:**

Choshi's signature fish requires specific selection knowledge to distinguish true kinmedai from similar species and identify quality grades. [🔗](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/nanyo-kinmedai/)

**Distinguish Species:** Nanyo kinmedai is a much flatter and taller fish compared to kinmedai, sold for a cheaper price with less marbling of fat. Look for body shape differences to avoid being sold the cheaper variety. [🔗](https://thejapanesefoodlab.com/nanyo-kinmedai/)

**Grade Quality:** KINME-DAI has 3 grades, with the highest called JI-KINME-DAI, strictly limited to the Day's Catch only - the most fresh, tastiest and fattiest. [🔗](https://gohinode.com/hinode-ji-kinmedai-fish-top-grade-golden-eye-red-snapper-fresh-frozen-by-ultra-rapid-freezing/) This top grade is what you should seek for the best quality.

**Physical Characteristics:** Bright red color, large eyes, and relatively small mouth. Large, round eyes that are highly reflective, giving them a golden or silvery appearance. [🔗](https://whitefinmarket.com/blogs/news/golden-eye-snapper-kinmedai) Measuring 30-50cm, fatty all year round, with soft flesh and few small bones. [🔗](https://www.bigfridgeboy.com/en/blog/7672/what-is-kinmedai-golden-eye-snapper-) Look for fish with good marbling and fat distribution throughout the body. [🔗](https://whitefinmarket.com/blogs/news/golden-eye-snapper-kinmedai)

**Freshness Indicators:** Fresh fish will say 生/nama on the pack if it was never frozen or 解凍/kaito (defrosted) if it has been frozen before. [🔗](https://tokyocheapo.com/living/grocery-shopping-japan-terms/) The highest grade fish suitable for raw consumption should say 刺身用/sashimi-yo (to be eaten as sashimi) on the pack. [🔗](https://tokyocheapo.com/living/grocery-shopping-japan-terms/)

**No Haggling:** Bargaining is not customary at Japanese markets. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html) Vendors at Wosse 21 are already very friendly and reasonably priced - there is no need to bargain. The Japanese market culture values fixed, fair pricing. Attempting to haggle may be seen as disrespectful or confusing to vendors who take pride in offering honest prices.

**Payment Methods:** Cash payment is most preferred at Japanese markets. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/) While specific Wosse 21 payment methods were not documented, bringing sufficient cash is recommended for both market purchases and restaurant dining.

### Dining Etiquette at Market Restaurants

**Seafood Restaurant Wosse (Second Floor):**

The 160-seat restaurant specializes in ultra-fresh seafood preparations. The most popular menu item is the seafood bowl (kaisendon/zuke-don) featuring kinmedai or tuna over rice, priced around ¥1,700. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

**Useful Phrases:**
- "Eigo no menyu arimasuka?" (英語のメニューありますか) - "Do you have an English menu?" [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0002722/)
- "Kore kudasai" (これください) - "This one please" (when pointing) [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0002722/)
- "Osusume wa nan desu ka?" (おすすめは何ですか) - "What do you recommend?" [🔗](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/useful-phrases-and-words-for-dining-out-in-japan)
- "Futari desu" (二人です) - "For two people" [🔗](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/useful-phrases-and-words-for-dining-out-in-japan)
- "Okaikei wo onegaishimasu" (お会計をお願いします) - "Can I have the bill, please?" [🔗](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/useful-phrases-and-words-for-dining-out-in-japan)

**Eating Technique:** For sushi or sashimi preparations, it's recommended to eat each piece in one bite, which allows you to experience the perfect harmony between the fish and rice. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/) Always dip only the fish (neta) side in soy sauce, as dipping the rice (shari) side will cause it to fall apart. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/)

**Chopstick Etiquette:** At a nice restaurant, it is considered rude to rub or scrape your chopsticks together as this implies that you think their chopsticks are cheap or poor quality. [🔗](https://www.japanlivingguide.com/expatinfo/japaneseculture/restaurant-etiquette/) Do not stick your chopsticks upright in your rice bowl as this gesture is tied to traditional Buddhist funeral rites. [🔗](https://www.japanlivingguide.com/expatinfo/japaneseculture/restaurant-etiquette/)

**No Tipping:** Tipping is not necessary at Japanese sushi restaurants or fish markets, as this is an established part of Japanese culture. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/) If you do tip, you will probably find the restaurant staff chasing you down in order to give back any money left behind. [🔗](https://boutiquejapan.com/tipping-in-japan/) Instead of tipping, it is polite to say "gochisosama deshita" (ごちそうさまでした - "thank you for the meal") when leaving. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/)

**Restaurant Conduct:** Maintain appropriate distance from other customers and keep conversations minimal. Respect everyone's space, avoid loud conversations, and maintain a calm atmosphere. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/how-to-enjoy-high-end-sushi-restaurants-in-japan-complete-guide-to-proper-etiquette/)

### Optimal Visiting Strategy

- Expect larger portions than typical Tokyo restaurants [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html)
- The miso soup with fresh seaweed is particularly noteworthy [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

**Shopping:**

### Managing Expectations

**What Wosse 21 IS:**
- An authentic working-port market with fresh local seafood
- A more intimate, accessible alternative to Tokyo's massive markets
- A place to experience Choshi's fishing heritage firsthand

**What Wosse 21 IS NOT:**

- A major tourist attraction with multilingual signage and international facilities

Some visitors found the market "nothing special" compared to Tokyo's larger markets, noting its smaller scale. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021144-d2005854-Reviews-Wosse21-Choshi_Chiba_Prefecture_Kanto.html) However, others appreciated the abundance of selection, reasonable prices, and authentic working-port atmosphere. The experience is best for visitors seeking local authenticity rather than a highly curated tourist destination.
