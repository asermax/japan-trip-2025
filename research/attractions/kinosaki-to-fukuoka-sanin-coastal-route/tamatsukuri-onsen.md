Tamatsukuri Onsen is one of Japan's oldest and most culturally significant hot spring resorts, dating back to at least 733 AD when it was introduced as "The Bath of The Gods" in the Ancient Chronicles of Izumo (Izumo-no-Kuni Fudoki).

This picturesque hot spring town sits along both banks of the Tamayu River, which flows into Lake Shinji, creating a scenic riverside setting lined with 22 traditional ryokan and modern hotels. The town is renowned as "bijin-no-yu" (bath of beauties) thanks to scientifically verified waters containing Japan's highest concentration of skin-moisturizing ingredients.

The name "Tamatsukuri" literally means "bead-making," reflecting the area's profound historical importance as a major production center for magatama - the sacred curved jewels that constitute one of Japan's Three Imperial Regalia. From the mid-3rd century to the late 12th century, skilled artisans from this region crafted ceremonial beads from high-quality agate, making Tamatsukuri a cultural hub of national importance.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Ancient Origins and Mythology

Tamatsukuri Onsen holds profound mythological importance in Japanese culture. According to ancient records, this is where gods are said to bathe once a year since the creation of Japan according to the myth of Izanagi and Izanami, the deities who created the Japanese archipelago. The oldest surviving record, the Izumo-no-Kuni Fudoki (733 AD), claims that "bathing here once would make one more beautiful, while bathing here twice would cure all maladies." [ðŸ”—](https://www.kankou-shimane.com/en/destinations/9283)

The onsen is located in the Izumo region, considered the "Land of the Gods" (Kamigami no Kuni) in Japanese mythology, where deities gather annually during the month of Kamiarizuki. This sacred geography adds layers of spiritual significance to the bathing experience. [ðŸ”—](https://donnykimball.com/tamatsukuri-onsen-4b48c54bf185)

### Imperial Regalia Connection

Tamatsukuri's magatama craft tradition directly connects to Japanese sovereignty and imperial authority. The sacred curved beads produced here became one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan (along with a mirror and sword). Three areas around Tamatsukuri Onsen contain numerous ancient jewel-making workshop remains and artifacts, designated as national historic sites.

### The Beautifying Waters - Scientific Verification

In 2010, scientific verification confirmed that Tamatsukuri Onsen's water contains a higher proportion of skin-moisturizing ingredients than any other onsen in Japan. The water's moisturizing properties are so exceptional that it's sometimes described as "natural lotion," and pharmaceutical companies have praised its excellent moisturizing qualities. The sulfate spring composition leaves skin feeling moisturized and smooth, with bathers reporting that their skin stays warm for extended periods after bathing.
