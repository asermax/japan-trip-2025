The Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo stands as one of Japan's premier archaeological museums, opened in 2007 to preserve and showcase the extraordinary cultural heritage of ancient Izumo Province. Designed by renowned Pritzker Prize-winning architect Fumihiko Maki, the museum's 120-meter long Cor-Ten steel facade deliberately evokes the region's historic tatara ironmaking traditionâ€”the pure iron production method that created Japan's legendary swords.

Located directly beside the sacred grounds of Izumo-taisha Grand Shrine, the museum serves as the definitive cultural companion to understanding one of Japan's most important Shinto sites. The museum's permanent collection focuses on three core themes: the architectural evolution and religious importance of Izumo-taisha shrine, the complete eighth-century Izumo no Kuni Fudoki gazetteer (Japan's only surviving complete provincial record), and the remarkable bronze artifacts from the Yayoi period (800 BCEâ€“300 CE).

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The region of Izumo holds exceptional significance in Japanese mythology and early political history, often called the "land of the gods." The museum's collections provide archaeological evidence for understanding the power and cultural sophistication of ancient Izumo, a region that features prominently in Japan's earliest written chronicles like the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. [ðŸ”—](https://ancient-japan-izumo.com/history/chapter1)

The museum's most magnificent display showcases 358 bronze swords unearthed at the Kojindani archaeological site in 1984-1985â€”more bronze swords than have been found in all the rest of Japan combined. These ritual implements, designated as National Treasures in 1998, demonstrated the existence of a powerful political and religious force in ancient Izumo, challenging conventional understandings of regional power dynamics during the Yayoi period.

## The Experience

### The Uzubashira Pillars (Central Lobby)

The museum's dramatic entrance features the actual excavated remains of the Uzubashiraâ€”colossal wooden pillars that once supported Izumo-taisha's thirteenth-century main sanctuary. Discovered during archaeological excavations beginning in 2000, these bundled pillars formed massive supports measuring 3 meters in diameter, providing tangible proof of the shrine's legendary ancient grandeur.

### The Kojindani Bronze Treasures (National Treasures)

The museum showcases 358 bronze swordsâ€”more than have been found in all the rest of Japan combinedâ€”alongside 16 bronze spearheads and 6 bronze bells. The exhibit hall presents both the original National Treasure artifacts and a stunning wall of gleaming reconstructions that convey how brilliantly these bronze blades would have shone when originally buried as religious offerings.

### Izumo-taisha Architectural Evolution

The museum features extensive models and reconstructions documenting the architectural history of Izumo-taisha's main sanctuary. Historical records suggest that early versions of the shrine may have reached an astonishing 48 meters in height, with the gallery displaying various architectural models representing scholarly attempts to reconstruct these monumental ancient structures.

### The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki Exhibition

The museum houses Japan's only complete version of the Izumo no Kuni Fudoki, an eighth-century provincial gazetteer compiled in 733 AD. The exhibit recreates daily life in ancient Izumo through this document, which preserves unique Izumo mythology including the Kunibiki (Land Pulling) legend and references to the gateway to the land of the dead.
