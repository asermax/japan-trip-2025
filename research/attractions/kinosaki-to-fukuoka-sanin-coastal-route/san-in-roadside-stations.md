Michi-no-Eki (道の駅, literally "road station") are government-designated rest areas along major highways and local roads in Japan, providing essential services for long-distance drivers. Along the San-in coastal route through Tottori and Shimane prefectures, these roadside stations serve as cultural gateways to the region's coastal seafood, traditional crafts, and local specialties. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/michi-no-eki/)

The San-in region's roadside stations particularly emphasize seafood products from the Sea of Japan, traditional Izumo specialties, and regional agricultural products distinct from the inland Chugoku corridor. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/article/item/20932/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Michi-no-Eki roadside stations represent a uniquely Japanese approach to highway infrastructure, combining practical rest stop services with cultural tourism and regional economic development. To register with the government as a Michi-no-Eki, facilities must provide three essential functions: free 24-hour parking, free 24-hour rest facilities (restrooms), and information services. [🔗](https://japantravelplanning.com/michi-no-eki/)

In the San-in region specifically, roadside stations serve an additional cultural preservation role - showcasing traditional coastal fishing culture, regional crafts, and agricultural products from an area that has historically been more isolated than the southern San-yo corridor. These stations help sustain local economies by providing direct-to-consumer sales channels for farmers, fishermen, and artisans. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/article/item/20932/)

**Important Distinction:** Michi-no-Eki are located along national highways and general roads (like Route 9), not directly on expressways. For the San-in coastal route, these stations are integrated into the journey along coastal roads rather than requiring expressway exits. [🔗](https://fukuokaeats.com/eats/fukuoka-specialties/)
