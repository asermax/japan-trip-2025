Kiyama Parking Area (基山パーキングエリア/基山PA) is the largest parking area on the Kyushu Expressway, positioned at the border between Fukuoka and Saga prefectures. Located in the busiest section of the expressway between Chikushino IC and Tosu JCT, this facility is exceptional in scale, rivaling or exceeding standard Service Areas. The parking area opened on March 13, 1975 and has evolved into a major rest stop and transportation hub for Kyushu travelers. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyama_Parking_Area)

The facility's reputation extends beyond its size - it's known for having the largest shopping area in western Japan for a parking area, featuring extensive food courts, specialty shops, and brand-name restaurants including Japan's first expressway convenience store (7-Eleven, opened November 17, 2006). [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/基山パーキングエリア) The PA's "Welcome Gate" feature allows access from general roads without using the expressway, making it a destination for locals and travelers alike, operating 24 hours a day. [🔗](https://www.w-holdings.co.jp/sapa/25090/)

The PA's culinary offerings have achieved legendary status, particularly the Niku Udon (meat udon) which sells over 10,000 bowls monthly and has maintained its traditional recipe for over 40 years. [🔗](https://w-holdings.co.jp/sapa/2671.html)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Kiyama PA represents the evolution of Japanese expressway rest facilities from basic amenities to comprehensive cultural destinations. Its scale and offerings rival full Service Areas, demonstrating the Japanese commitment to making highway travel a complete experience rather than mere transit. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/基山パーキングエリア)

The PA's position at the Fukuoka-Saga prefectural border makes it a cultural crossroads, showcasing products and cuisine from both regions. Its dual role as highway rest area and bus transfer hub since July 1, 2007 reflects the integrated nature of Japanese transportation infrastructure.

The legendary Niku Udon's 40+ year traditional recipe preservation demonstrates commitment to culinary heritage within modern facilities. [🔗](https://w-holdings.co.jp/sapa/2671.html)
