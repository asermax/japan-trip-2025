Miyahara Service Area (宮原サービスエリア) stands as one of the most significant rest facilities on the Kyushu Expressway, located in Hikawa Town, Kumamoto Prefecture. Opened in March 1980, this service area underwent major renovations in 2012 (upbound line) and 2016 (downbound restaurant area), transforming it into what's described as "South Kyushu's largest dining and souvenir destination." [🔗](https://www.kyusanko.co.jp/sa/miyahara_kudari/)

The service area's strategic location makes it particularly important for long-distance travelers. Positioned just before a mountainous section containing 23 consecutive tunnels, Miyahara SA serves as the last major 24-hour facility for southbound drivers heading toward Kagoshima and Miyazaki. Until 2007, it held the distinction of being Japan's southernmost 24-hour service area. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/宮原サービスエリア)

What sets Miyahara apart is its comprehensive facilities operating around the clock. The downbound line (toward Kagoshima/Miyazaki) features 24-hour shopping and dining options, while the upbound line (toward Fukuoka) offers similarly extensive services. Both directions include ENEOS gas stations operating 24/7, making this an essential fuel stop for overnight or early morning journeys. [🔗](https://japanshopping.org/search/shops/detail/15571)

The service area's location offers scenic views of Mount Unzen and the Amakusa region, providing a pleasant rest environment for tired drivers. The facility includes "Welcome Gates" on both sides, allowing access from regular roads without entering the expressway - a unique feature that makes it popular with local residents as well as highway travelers.

Miyahara SA serves dual purposes: a practical highway rest facility and a showcase of Kumamoto and northern Kyushu regional culture through its extensive souvenir shops and restaurants featuring local specialties.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Miyahara Service Area represents the evolution of Japanese expressway culture from basic rest facilities to comprehensive regional showcases. The 2012 and 2016 renovations transformed the service area into a destination that celebrates Kumamoto and northern Kyushu's culinary and cultural heritage.

The service area's commitment to regional products, particularly through the Kumamoto Shunsaikan (旬彩館) shop, supports local producers and artisans. Live demonstrations of ikinari dango making at the Hanamarudo specialty shop preserve and showcase traditional Kumamoto confectionery techniques. [🔗](https://kids.rurubu.jp/article/sapa/80040418/)
