Kurume City Center serves as the birthplace of tonkotsu ramen, with the first shop opening in 1937 at the portable food stall Nankin Senryo on Meiji-Dori. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/articles/kurume-ramen) Located in southern Fukuoka Prefecture along the Chikugo River, Kurume offers route travelers a unique opportunity to experience authentic tonkotsu ramen culture alongside traditional crafts including kasuri textiles and Rantai lacquerware. The city center is approximately 10-15 minutes from Route 3, making it an accessible culinary and cultural stop.

In 1937, Tokio Miyamoto opened a portable food stall called Nankin Senryo on Meiji-Dori street, creating the first tonkotsu ramen. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/articles/kurume-ramen) Initially serving a clear soup similar to chuka soba, the iconic cloudy white broth emerged in 1947 when another vendor, Katsumi Sugino of the Sankyu stall, accidentally left his soup cooking too long, creating the pure white, rich broth that defines tonkotsu ramen today.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The city center revolves around Nishitetsu Kurume Station, where 11 ramen shops cluster within a 10-minute walk, forming a ramen walking route through the historic district. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/12924) The area also features Kurume Ramen Yokocho (Ramen Alley) in the Bunka Gai neighborhood, a nostalgic back alleyway lined with unique ramen shops and food stalls that continue Kurume's 80+ year tradition of street food culture.

**What Makes Kurume Ramen Distinct:** Kurume ramen employs the hagama (round-bottomed cooking pot) method and yobidashi technique where broth is stewed for extended periods and topped up as it reduces. This creates a richer, more gelatinous tonkotsu than Hakata or Nagahama varieties, with somewhat thicker noodles. [ðŸ”—](https://welcome-kurume.com/en/enjoys/gourmet/foods_01.html)

Beyond ramen, Kurume preserves traditional crafts including Kurume kasuri, an indigo-dyed cotton fabric designated as a National Important Intangible Asset invented over 200 years ago by 12-year-old Den Inoue. [ðŸ”—](https://kurumekasuri.jp/en/about/) The city is also known for Rantai lacquerware, traditional bamboo pieces woven and coated with multiple layers of lacquer that become more beautiful with use.

Kurume Suitengu Shrine, constructed in 1190 and relocated to its current riverside location in 1650, serves as the headquarters for all Suitengu shrines in Japan. The shrine venerates Emperor Antoku as the god of water and has evolved to become known for protecting safe childbirth. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurume_SuitengÅ«)
