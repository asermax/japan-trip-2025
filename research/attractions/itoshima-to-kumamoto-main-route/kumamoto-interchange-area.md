Kumamoto Interchange represents the primary entry point to Kumamoto city from the Kyushu Expressway, marking the southern terminus of the drive from Fukuoka and Itoshima. Opened on June 30, 1971, as part of the first section of the Kyushu Expressway in Kumamoto Prefecture, this interchange has served as the main gateway to Japan's castle town for over five decades. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu_Expressway)

The interchange underwent significant reconstruction following the April 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, which damaged ramp bridges and toll booth roofs. A modernized toll booth began operations on November 19, 2017, incorporating seismic improvements and enhanced safety features. This reconstruction represents the resilience of Kumamoto's infrastructure recovery. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/熊本インターチェンジ)

As a route stop, Kumamoto IC serves primarily as a transition point rather than a destination. The interchange itself doesn't have dedicated facilities - true to Japanese expressway design, amenities are concentrated at nearby Kitakumamoto Service Area, located just 5-8 km north.
