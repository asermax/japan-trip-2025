Kiyomizu Temple (正式名称: 長谷寺 Chokoku-ji, commonly known as 清水寺 Kiyomizu or 清水観音 Kiyomizu Kannon) is a Tendai Buddhist temple located at the foot of Hanaoka Mountain behind Kumamoto Station. The temple has a poignant historical connection to Kyoto - it was established when provincial governors (kokushi) who served in Higo Province grew homesick for their native Kyoto and decided to recreate elements of their hometown. They modeled the local Hanaoka Mountain (formerly called Gion-yama) after Kyoto's famous Higashiyama district and invited Kiyomizu-dera to establish a branch temple here.

The temple operates as a branch of Jingo-ji under the Tendai Buddhist sect, and is dedicated to the Thousand-Armed Kannon (千手観音 Senju Kannon), representing Buddhist compassion and salvation. In the late 19th century, when the local priest retired, the nearby Hase Temple (established in the 8th century) was merged with Kiyomizu Temple, creating the temple's dual identity that persists today.

The temple grounds contain a culturally significant stone pagoda (宝篋印塔 hokyointo) dedicated to Gocho, a prominent Higo Buddhist monk who devoted most of his life to saving all beings and constructed over 2,000 stone pagodas throughout the region. [🔗](https://kumamoto.guide/spots/detail/12397)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Historical Connection to Kyoto

Kiyomizu Temple embodies the cultural ties between Kumamoto and Kyoto during the provincial governance period. The temple's establishment represents the deep homesickness (郷愁 kyoshu) experienced by Kyoto-born officials serving in distant provinces. By recreating elements of their beloved Higashiyama district and inviting a branch temple of the famous Kiyomizu-dera, these officials created a spiritual connection to their homeland while serving far from home.

### The Rare Stone San-mon Gate

The temple's most distinctive feature is its stone entrance gate (San-mon), which is exceptionally rare in Japanese temple architecture. The gate's surface features intricate curved patterns - the upper portion illustrates clouds while the bottom half depicts waves. According to Buddhist symbolism, crossing through this gate represents entering Buddha's body, making it a spiritually significant threshold. [🔗](https://untappedkumamoto.com/shrinetemple/3556)

### Gocho's Stone Pagoda Legacy

The hokyointo pagoda dedicated to the monk Gocho represents an important aspect of Kumamoto's Buddhist heritage. Gocho devoted his life to the salvation of all beings, constructing over 2,000 stone pagodas throughout the Higo region. This particular pagoda stands as a testament to his lifetime of compassionate service and the enduring tradition of stone monument construction in Kumamoto Buddhism.

This unusual stone construction makes it a distinctive architectural feature in Japanese temple architecture. As you pass through, contemplate the Buddhist symbolism of entering Buddha's body, crossing the threshold from the mundane world into sacred space.

### Eighteen Rakan Statues

The temple grounds feature a collection of 18 Rakan statues - disciples of Buddha who achieved enlightenment and became high priests. These statues represent different aspects of Buddhist teachings and are positioned throughout the temple grounds. Visitors can observe the individual characteristics and expressions of each Rakan, which traditionally symbolize various states of spiritual attainment.

This interactive religious element allows visitors to engage directly with Buddhist practices. [🔗](https://untappedkumamoto.com/shrinetemple/3556)
