The Kumamoto City Handicrafts Promotion Center (くまもと工芸会館 / Kumamoto Kōgei Kaikan) stands as a vital cultural institution preserving and promoting the traditional crafts of Kumamoto, particularly those originating from Kawashiri, a historic port town with over 800 years of craftsmanship heritage. [🔗](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/culture/en/kougei/)

Located in the Minami-ku district, this center functions as both a living museum and an active workshop space where visitors can "see, touch, and experience" traditional handicrafts ranging from the renowned Higo zogan (gold inlay metalwork) to Kawashiri knives, bamboo crafts, and Higo spinning tops.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The center embodies Kumamoto's deep connection to traditional crafts, which flourished under the patronage of the Hosokawa clan during the Edo period (1603-1868). Higo zogan, the region's most famous craft, was originally developed by gunsmith Matashichi Hayashi to adorn samurai weaponry and sword guards. [🔗](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/higozogan/)

After the Meiji Restoration abolished samurai culture, local artisans adapted their skills to create personal accessories and decorative items, ensuring the survival of these intricate metalworking techniques into the modern era. [🔗](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/higozogan/)

The facility operates as a comprehensive craft hub featuring dedicated workshops including a pottery studio, knife workshop, and creative studios. [🔗](https://kumamoto-kougei.jp/english/) The center's "Kura" craft shop displays items from over 60 local artisans. [🔗](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/culture/en/kougei/)
