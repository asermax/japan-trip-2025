Basashi (馬刺し), also poetically called "sakura niku" (cherry meat) due to its delicate pink color, is Kumamoto's most iconic culinary specialty and a 400-year-old tradition with deep historical roots. As Japan's largest producer of horse meat (accounting for 40% of national production), Kumamoto offers the finest and most authentic basashi experience in the country. This raw horse meat delicacy represents not just a unique dining opportunity for international visitors, but a window into Kumamoto's samurai heritage and regional food culture.

## Historical Origins & Cultural Significance

Basashi's origin traces back to 1592 and Kato Kiyomasa, the legendary first lord of the Kumamoto domain and builder of Kumamoto Castle. During Kiyomasa's military campaign in Korea, his forces were besieged and supply lines cut off. Facing starvation, Kiyomasa made the heart-wrenching decision to kill military horses for food—animals he deeply loved and valued as warriors' companions. He and his soldiers survived by eating the horses, and Kiyomasa found the meat so unexpectedly delicious that he continued to enjoy it after returning to Japan, establishing a tradition that would define Kumamoto's cuisine for four centuries. [🔗](https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/market/k_ryouri/search_menu/4013/index.html) [🔗](http://kyoudo-ryouri.com/en/food/1498.html)

The practice expanded in the post-war era when people in the Aso region began eating horse meat due to food shortages, and restaurants began serving horse meat commercially in the 1950s. Modern Kumamoto has transformed this necessity into culinary artistry, with Kumamoto Prefecture producing around 40% of Japan's horse meat supply and earning recognition as "the mecca of horse meat eating culture."

## Why Basashi is Served Raw

Basashi is served raw as sashimi because of the meat's exceptional freshness, tenderness, and food safety standards. Unlike beef or pork, horse meat has a much lower risk of parasites and pathogens, making it safe to consume raw when properly sourced and handled. The raw preparation allows diners to appreciate the meat's delicate sweet flavor, tender texture, and nutritional profile—low in fat and calories but high in protein and rich in minerals such as iron, calcium, and zinc. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kyushu/kumamoto/basashi/) [🔗](https://www.tasteatlas.com/basashi)

Kumamoto's basashi is particularly renowned because the region maintains stringent quality control and hygienic standards from farm to table, with some establishments like Suganoya holding international certification as the only specialized horse meat processing facility in Japan certified safe to eat raw by the Safe Quality Food Institute.

## Varieties & Cuts

Basashi offers a fascinating range of cuts, each with distinct characteristics:

**Premium Cuts:**
- **Loin/Tenderloin** - Most tender and rare cuts, exceptional softness and rich flavor [🔗](https://www.trivialbites.com/strange-eats/horse-sashimi-japans-raw-take-on-eating-horse-meat-cultural-delicacy-unveiled/)
- **Toro** - Finest part of rib meat, prized for marbling and melt-in-mouth texture [🔗](https://www.trivialbites.com/strange-eats/horse-sashimi-japans-raw-take-on-eating-horse-meat-cultural-delicacy-unveiled/)

## The Dining Experience

**Taste and Texture:**
Basashi consistently surprises first-time diners with its unexpectedly mild, refined character. The meat is lean and tender with a subtle sweetness that some compare to tuna or beef carpaccio, offering a flavor profile somewhere between beef and venison but without any gamey notes. The texture varies by cut—premium loin melts on the tongue while lean thigh provides satisfying chewiness. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/) [🔗](https://www.trivialbites.com/strange-eats/basashi/)

**Proper Eating Etiquette:**

1. Place soy sauce in a small dish
2. Add grated ginger and garlic to the soy sauce (traditional ratio is 1:1) [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/)
3. Place a slice of basashi on your plate
4. Add ginger/garlic garnish directly onto the meat
5. Dip the meat lightly in soy sauce
6. Eat in one bite to appreciate the full flavor profile
7. Optional: Add wasabi, shiso leaves, or sliced onions for variation [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/) [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kyushu/kumamoto/basashi/)

**Pro Tip:** Request thinly sliced sashimi—the thinner the cut, the softer and more enjoyable the texture. Don't overload with condiments; the goal is to enhance, not mask, the meat's natural sweetness.

**Beverage Pairings:**
- **Shochu** - Kumamoto's local spirit, particularly iichiko or mugi (barley) shochu [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/)
- **Cold Sake** - Clean, crisp sake cuts through the meat's fattiness
- **Beer** - Asahi or local craft beer offers refreshing contrast
- **Green Tea** - For non-alcohol drinkers

**Dietary Restrictions:** Basashi is naturally gluten-free (though soy sauce accompaniment contains gluten). It's high in protein and low in fat, making it suitable for many dietary preferences.
