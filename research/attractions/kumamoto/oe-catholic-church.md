Oe Catholic Church (Oe Tenshudo/å¤§æ±Ÿå¤©ä¸»å ‚) stands as the oldest Catholic church in Amakusa and one of the first churches built immediately after the ban on Christianity was lifted in 1873. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/spots/detail/935) The chalky white Romanesque-style structure was rebuilt in 1933 by French missionary Father Louis Garnier using his personal fortune and contributions from local Christians in the area. [ðŸ”—](https://goamakusa.com/oe-church/)

Father Garnier (1860-1941) came to Japan in 1885 at age 25, studied Japanese in Kyoto, was assigned to several churches in Nagasaki, and in 1892, at age 32, was assigned to Oe Church as a priest. [ðŸ”—](http://www.qsr.mlit.go.jp/suishin/story2019/english/04_6.html) He lived a simple life in Amakusa until his death in 1941 at age 82, eating the same food as the believers in poor Amakusa and wearing a patchwork priest's uniform. He was affectionately called "Pateru-san" (Father in Latin) by his followers who loved him very much. [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-1310183/)

The church sits majestically on top of a small hill, commanding views of the surrounding valley. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/community/mfedley/report-3324) The Romanesque architecture and bright white building contrast beautifully against the blue sky on sunny days, creating an almost painting-like scene. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-kyushu-tourist.com/oe-cathedral-amakusa/) The church is surrounded by cycads, palms, and other tropical trees and flowers which accentuate the whiteness of the building, giving the Romanesque structure a stylish feel. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/spots/detail/935)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The church represents a significant component of the Amakusa region's Christian heritage, closely associated with the "Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region" UNESCO World Heritage designation (inscribed July 2018), with twelve sites inscribed in the coastal area of Nagasaki and Kumamoto prefectures. [ðŸ”—](https://nippon100.com/en/hidden-christians-amakusa-kyushu-churches) While Oe Church itself is not directly listed as a World Heritage site, it is intimately connected to this heritage and often called "the mountain church" in contrast to nearby Sakitsu Church which is "the sea church." [ðŸ”—](https://tenku-f.hmup.jp/blog/76)

Father Garnier's nearly 50 years of dedicated missionary service (1892-1941) represents a profound example of cross-cultural religious exchange. His simple lifestyle and dedication earned deep respect from local Christians, and his legacy continues through the church he rebuilt and the community he served.
