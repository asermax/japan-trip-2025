Kamitori Shopping Arcade stands as Kumamoto's northern cultural and artistic shopping hub, distinguished by its elegant Paris-inspired architecture and serene atmosphere. Stretching 586 meters in length and 10.9 meters in width, this fully covered arcade houses approximately 170 shops, restaurants, boutiques, jewelry stores, and cafes.

The arcade's most striking feature is its high arched ceiling, designed in the style of Paris's MusÃ©e d'Orsay, with large skylights flooding the space with natural light and creating an airy, spacious ambiance. This architectural choice earned the arcade the prestigious "Kumamoto Landscape Encouragement Award" from Kumamoto Prefecture. The center walkway is lined with beautiful ipe hardwood from South America, adding warmth and elegance to the shopping experience. [ðŸ”—](https://voyapon.com/kamitori-kumamoto-shopping-arcade/)

## Historical & Cultural Context

The area's history reflects Kumamoto's urban evolution. During the feudal era, it served as residences for lower-ranking samurai. In the Meiji period, government forces burned the area during the Satsuma Rebellion to observe enemy movements. Post-war redevelopment attracted schools to the area, which in turn drew businesses targeting students, including bookstores, stationery shops, clothing stores, and clock shops.

Kamitori first laid wooden bricks in Kumamoto in 1925 (Taisho 14), and despite being impacted by the 2016 earthquakes, the arcade remains a vibrant mix of culture, history, and contemporary shopping. The arcade maintains a more refined, sophisticated character compared to its sister arcade Shimotori, with abundant use of wood and numerous longstanding stores creating a more serene, laid-back atmosphere.
