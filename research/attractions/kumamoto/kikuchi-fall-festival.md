**IMPORTANT TIMING NOTE:** The Kikuchi Fall Festival (locally called "Shinmiya-San") takes place annually on **October 13-15**, NOT in November. For a November 1, 2025 visit, this festival will have already concluded. However, Kikuchi offers alternative autumn experiences in early November, particularly the **Kikuchi Gorge Illumination Event (November 1-10)** featuring nighttime light displays and peak autumn foliage viewing.

The Shinmiya-San Fall Festival is a historic samurai heritage celebration held annually in mid-October at Kikuchi Shrine in Kikuchi City, Kumamoto Prefecture. The festival honors the legendary Kikuchi clan, who produced 24 generations of samurai leaders ruling Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto) from the 8th to 16th centuries.

The festival's centerpiece is the spectacular samurai procession featuring 24 warriors, each representing one generation of the Kikuchi clan leadership and carrying flags inscribed with the clan head's name. Each samurai wears armor in subtly different colors, creating a visual timeline of the family's centuries of rule. This procession is open to public participation, with the Kikuchi Tourist Association accepting applications from August each year for those wishing to march in authentic samurai armor.

The festival also showcases Onmatsubayashi Onnou, a traditional performance art dating to the 16th century, designated as a nationally important intangible folk cultural asset. This ritual performance is dedicated to the shrine as a prayer for peace, maintaining living connections to practices that have endured for over 400 years.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The Kikuchi clan distinguished themselves as defenders of imperial authority, particularly during the Mongol invasions of Japan when Kikuchi Takefusa helped drive back the enemy in the 13th century. The clan reached its peak prominence during the Kenmu Restoration of 1333, when Kikuchi Taketoki served as Emperor Go-Daigo's right-hand man in overthrowing the Kamakura shogunate. For this loyalty, Kikuchi Shrine was established in 1870 by Emperor Meiji as one of the Fifteen Shrines of the Kenmu Restoration, enshrining three clan leaders: Taketoki (1292-1333), Takeshige (1307?-1338?), and Takemitsu (c.1319-1373).

Beyond its samurai pageantry, the Shinmiya-San festival celebrates Kikuchi's agricultural heritage as one of Kumamoto Prefecture's most productive rice and vegetable farming regions. The autumn timing gives thanks for the harvest bounty, with festival food stalls offering local specialties and fresh produce from the surrounding countryside.
