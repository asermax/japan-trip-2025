Higo Dining Soro offers an authentic window into one of Kumamoto's most distinctive culinary traditions - basashi, or horse meat sashimi. This delicacy traces its origins back approximately 400 years to 1592, when Kato Kiyomasa, the first lord of the Higo Kumamoto domain, found himself short of food during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign in Korea. When Kiyomasa's forces were under siege and supply lines were cut off, he and his soldiers stayed alive by eating their horses. The meat was so delicious that Kiyomasa continued to enjoy horse meat and basashi after returning to Japan, establishing a tradition that has become deeply ingrained in Kumamoto culture.

Today, Kumamoto is Japan's largest producer of horse meat, accounting for approximately 40% of the nation's supply. Basashi is affectionately called "sakura niku" (cherry meat) due to its delicate pink color, and has become one of Kumamoto's most famous local specialties.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

Basashi represents a 400-year evolution from wartime necessity to celebrated culinary art. The tradition expanded significantly in the 1950s post-war period when horses began being raised specifically for consumption in the Aso region. By 1965, dedicated horse meat ranching established basashi as a Kumamoto culinary cornerstone. Beyond its cultural significance, horse meat offers exceptional nutritional benefits: high protein, low fat, and rich in iron, calcium, and zinc. [ðŸ”—](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kyushu/kumamoto/basashi/)

The restaurant showcases multiple basashi cuts, each offering distinct textures and flavors: [ðŸ”—](https://en.akumamoto.jp/archives/220631)

- **Toro:** The finest part of the horse's rib meat - tender, completely trimmed, and highly prized
- **Shimofuri:** Fabulously marbled premium meat with intricate fat distribution
- **Akami:** Lean red meat offering clean, pure horse meat flavor
- **Tategami:** Horse neck fat - soft, creamy, and collagen-rich

Basashi is traditionally served with thinly sliced onions, grated fresh ginger, grated garlic, finely chopped green onions, and sweet soy sauce (the Kumamoto way).

## The Dining Experience

**For First-Time Basashi Eaters:**

Understanding basashi enhances the experience. Horse meat is leaner than beef with a subtle, delicate flavor and tender texture. The pink color comes from the meat's natural myoglobin content - it's completely fresh and safe when sourced from reputable establishments. [ðŸ”—](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kyushu/kumamoto/basashi/)

**How to Eat Basashi:**
1. Take a slice of horse meat with your chopsticks
2. Dip lightly into sweet soy sauce [ðŸ”—](https://www.umamiinfo.com/japaneseumami2/localcuisine/kumamoto.html)
3. Add grated garlic or ginger according to preference (start with small amounts)
4. Place sliced onions on top if desired
5. Enjoy the tender texture and subtle flavor
6. Pair with local shochu, especially rice-based varieties from Kumamoto [ðŸ”—](https://medium.com/@satoshiashkanemura/basashi-in-japan-where-to-try-raw-horse-meat-in-kumamoto-and-beyond-586e8bb8db99)

**Izakaya Cultural Experience:**

Upon seating, you'll receive a small appetizer (otoshi) automatically. This functions as a table charge (typically a few hundred yen) and should not be refused - think of it as similar to a tip or cover charge. [ðŸ”—](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/a-guide-to-manners-and-etiquette-at-izakaya)

If no call button or tablet is available, politely say "sumimasen" (excuse me) to call the waiter. The first toast accompanies a cheerful "Kanpai!" with light glass clinking. [ðŸ”—](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/a-guide-to-manners-and-etiquette-at-izakaya)

**Additional Menu Items:**
Beyond basashi, the restaurant excels in deftly prepared sashimi platters, carefully executed tempura sets, and seasonal autumn vegetables (kabocha, taro, sweet potato, mushrooms, aubergine). [ðŸ”—](https://en.akumamoto.jp/archives/220669)
