Yakiniku Aji Hitokire (焼肉 味ひときれ) stands out among Kumamoto's yakiniku establishments for its master butcher's exceptional eye for quality, sourcing only the finest Akaushi (Kumamoto's legendary red wagyu) and kuroge (black) wagyu, along with exceptionally rare cuts of horse meat including never-frozen harami (diaphragm) and liver sashimi.

The restaurant embodies Kumamoto's dual culinary heritage: its thousand-year-old tradition of raising Japanese Brown cattle (Akaushi) on the volcanic grasslands of Aso, and its 400-year-old basashi culture initiated by feudal lord Kiyomasa Kato, who discovered the deliciousness of horse meat during his Korean military campaigns.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

**Kumamoto's Akaushi Legacy:**

Kumamoto's Akaushi (赤牛, meaning "red cattle") represents one of Japan's four precious wagyu breeds, certified as traditional meat-breed wagyu in 1944. Unlike the heavily marbled black wagyu, Akaushi breeding focused on adaptability to Aso's volcanic grasslands rather than fat content, resulting in leaner beef with exceptionally rich umami from high free amino acid content and mild sweetness from glycogen.

This breed has maintained the Aso grasslands through a thousand-year cycle of burning, grazing, and harvesting - a system recognized as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Site. Kumamoto produces approximately 70% of Japan's Akaushi cattle, making this the definitive region to experience this rare wagyu variety.

**Kumamoto's Basashi Tradition:**

Kumamoto leads Japan as the nation's largest horse meat producer, accounting for 40% of domestic production. Basashi (馬刺し, horse sashimi) - also called sakura niku ("cherry meat") for its distinctive pink color - became embedded in Kumamoto culture following lord Kiyomasa Kato's discovery of its delicious taste during his 16th-century Korean campaigns. [🔗](https://en.akumamoto.jp/archives/221190/) [🔗](https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/market/k_ryouri/search_menu/4013/)

The practice expanded significantly in the 1950s post-war period when horses began being raised specifically for consumption in the Aso region. Beyond its cultural significance, horse meat offers exceptional nutritional benefits: high protein, low fat, and rich in iron, calcium, and zinc.

**Yakiniku Grilling Process:**

At yakiniku restaurants, you grill your own meat at the table. Follow proper etiquette: [🔗](https://umamibites.com/useful_info/yakiniku-etiquette-for-tourists) [🔗](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/how-to-eat-yakiniku)

- Use separate tongs for raw meat; chopsticks for eating
- Wait for grill to heat thoroughly before cooking
- Share grill space - allow all dining companions to place meat simultaneously
- Grill order: Start with unseasoned lean cuts, progress to fattier or seasoned meats
- Cooking times: Lean meat cooks quickly (remain more rare); fattier cuts need longer cooking
- Dip cooked meat lightly in sauce and enjoy immediately

**Basashi Service:**

Horse meat sashimi arrives pre-sliced, served with thinly sliced onions, grated ginger, fresh garlic, and sweet soy sauce for dipping. Different cuts offer distinct experiences - lean thigh meat provides pure flavor, marbled loin adds richness, while rare cuts like mane fat and futaego (belly) deliver unique textures.
