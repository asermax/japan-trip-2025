## Basic Information

**Note on Image:** Despite extensive research across Wikipedia Commons, official tourism sites, and licensed image repositories, no suitable, properly-licensed representative image for the Shinmachi/Furumachi/Kyomachi historic district could be located. The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake significantly damaged many traditional buildings in this area (reducing 445 documented machiya to 183 by 2019), which may explain limited photographic documentation.

Kyomachi (äº¬ç”º) is a historic neighborhood in Kumamoto City's Chuo-ku ward, forming part of the broader Shinmachi and Furumachi traditional castle town district. The area lies between Kumamoto Station and Kumamoto Castle, representing one of Kumamoto's oldest neighborhoods with preserved historic buildings dating back to the castle town era. The district was established by castle architect Kato Kiyomasa simultaneously with Kumamoto Castle's construction in the early 17th century. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/en/spots/detail/221)

Kyomachi gained historical prominence when Nishikiyama Shrine (later renamed Kato Shrine) was relocated there in 1874 after the Japanese Army acquired castle property. The district served as a transitional zone between the castle's administrative functions and the commercial activities along the Tsuboi River. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/spots/detail/12276)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Historical Development and Urban Planning

The Shinmachi/Furumachi/Kyomachi area represents Kumamoto's most significant preserved castle town district, established during the early Edo period (1601-1608) by Kato Kiyomasa. Shinmachi was positioned directly in front of Kumamoto Castle as a narrow, rectangular castle town enclosed by five castle gates, containing both samurai quarters and merchants' housingâ€”a rare integrated layout in Japanese castle towns. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/en/spots/detail/221)

The Furumachi section was designed with temples as community centers in a grid pattern, with shops lined along the Tsuboi River serving as a historical distribution hub. The area features traditional machiya townhousesâ€”integrated shop-residence buildings where merchants lived above or behind their businesses. These structures typically display white walls with black lattice facades (koshi), representing classic Edo-period merchant architecture. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/en/spots/detail/221)

### Earthquake Impact and Restoration

The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake devastated the district's architectural heritage. Of 445 documented machiya houses (211 in Shinmachi, 234 in Furumachi) surveyed in 2008, only 183 remained by July 2019. This catastrophic loss transformed the historical streetscape significantly. [ðŸ”—](https://datasci.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/casebank_en/1186/)

However, restoration efforts have breathed new life into surviving structures. The World Monuments Fund partnered with Kumamoto Machinami Trust to restore five iconic buildings, including Shio Kosho, Natural and Harmonic Purely, Nishimura Tei, PS Orangerie, and Kiyonaga Honten. This collaboration received the ICOMOS-Japan Award in 2019, establishing a model for disaster recovery that preserves cultural heritage while rebuilding community identity.

### Historic Establishments and Cultural Heritage

Long-established businesses continue operations in original locations, including Yoshida Shokado (pharmaceutical wholesaler since the 1830s) and Hyogoya Honten (soy sauce and miso manufacturer founded in 1715). The former Okyakuya inn, where historical figures Sakamoto Ryoma and Saigo Takamori reportedly stayed, adds to the district's historical significance. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto-guide.jp/en/spots/detail/221)

The Nishimura Residence, a registered tangible cultural property showcasing traditional merchant house architecture, now functions as a gallery and shop. The Hayakawa Warehouse, a former brewery from the early Meiji period, has evolved into an event space. [ðŸ”—](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kyushu/kumamoto-area/kumamoto/kanko-spot-8/)
