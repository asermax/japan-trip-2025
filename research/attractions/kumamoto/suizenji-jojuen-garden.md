Suizenji Jojuen Garden is a masterpiece of 17th-century Japanese landscape design that recreates the 53 post stations of the historic Tokaido Road in miniature form. Construction began in 1636 when Hosokawa Tadatoshi, the first daimyo of Kumamoto Domain, selected this site for its exceptional spring-fed pond fed by Mount Aso's pure waters, which were prized for producing the highest quality green tea. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suizen-ji_J%C5%8Dju-en) [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/636/)

The garden originally served as a chashitsu (tea ceremony structure) on the grounds of the Zen temple of Suizen-ji. Over approximately 80 years, the Hosokawa family transformed it into an elaborate strolling garden, with completion achieved under the third feudal lord, Hosokawa Tsunatoshi, who gave it the name "Seishu-en" inspired by classical Chinese poetry.

The garden exemplifies the tsukiyama style of Japanese garden design, featuring an artificial hill carefully sculpted to evoke Mount Fuji's perfect conical shape. The surrounding landscape meticulously recreates landmarks along the Tokaidoâ€”the famous road that connected Edo (Tokyo) with Kyoto during the feudal eraâ€”including miniature representations of Lake Biwa and other notable stations. This innovative design allowed feudal lords to symbolically journey from Edo to Kyoto without leaving Kumamoto.

The garden covers approximately 73,000 square meters and centers on a spring-fed pond filled with clear groundwater from Mount Aso. The pond is home to large, brightly colored koi fish and, famously, two white turtles that are said to bring good luck to those who spot them.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Within the garden grounds stands Izumi Shrine, erected in 1878 by former retainers of Kumamoto Domain following the Satsuma Rebellion. The shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the Hosokawa clan who ruled the region for over 400 years, from the mid-17th to late-19th century. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suizen-ji_J%C5%8Dju-en) [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/spots/detail/12386)

The Kokindenju-no-Ma teahouse, relocated from Kyoto's Imperial Palace during the Taisho Period (1912), represents the garden's deep connection to tea ceremony culture. Prince Hachijonomiya received the Kokindenju (secret teachings of classical poetry) from Hosokawa Yusai in this historic structure. Yusai, rumored to be an illegitimate son of the Emperor, was a celebrated scholar and samurai who inducted the Emperor's younger brother into the classical arts of ancient poetry.

The garden sustained damage during the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, with the shrine's stone torii gates collapsing or developing cracks. The main torii was reconstructed in wood, symbolizing both a desire to rebuild and preserving the memory of the earthquake, while the pond's spring water that had been drained was successfully restored.
