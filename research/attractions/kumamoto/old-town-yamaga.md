Old Town Yamaga is a beautifully preserved Edo-period post town located along the historic Buzen Kaido highway in northern Kumamoto Prefecture. During the Edo period (1603-1868), Yamaga flourished as a strategic settlement on the Buzen Kaido, the main route connecting Kumamoto Prefecture with northern Kyushu. This highway played a crucial role in the sankin-kotai system, whereby provincial lords (daimyo) traveled from their domains to Edo and back every two years. [ðŸ”—](https://en.japantravel.com/kumamoto/old-town-yamaga/17963)

The town developed during the Kamakura period as a hot spring destination and evolved into a prosperous commercial settlement during the Muromachi period, gaining particular fame for its umbrella production. Today, the kilometer-long Buzen Way retains much of its Edo-period atmosphere, with restored buildings featuring typical whitewashed walls and slate roofs characteristic of earlier centuries. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaga,_Kumamoto)

What makes Yamaga particularly special is its deep connection to the Yamaga lantern craft tradition, stretching back over 600 years. According to legend, Emperor Keiko traveled up the Kikuchi River but became engulfed in heavy fog. Villagers from Yamaga carrying torches guided them to safety, establishing a tradition of lantern offerings. During the Edo period, wealthy merchants supported competitions among washi paper craftsmen, elevating this craft to the status of a designated National Traditional Craft in 2013.

The historic district preserves cobblestone streets lined with sake breweries and malted rice shops dating to the mid-19th century, creating a retro atmosphere that transports visitors back in time. The area is anchored by two magnificent landmarks: the Yachiyoza Theatre, a National Important Cultural Property built in 1910 in the style of Edo-period Kabuki theaters, and Sakura-yu, an elegant public bathhouse that accurately replicates Edo-period architectural style and houses one of the largest wooden thermal constructions in Kyushu.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Buzen Kaido Highway and Sankin-Kotai System

The Buzen Kaido served as the main artery connecting Kumamoto with northern Kyushu during the Edo period, playing a vital role in the sankin-kotai system that required provincial lords to travel between their domains and Edo every two years. This system, designed by the Tokugawa shogunate to maintain control over regional lords, created a network of post towns that thrived on providing services to traveling processions. [ðŸ”—](https://en.japantravel.com/kumamoto/old-town-yamaga/17963)

Yamaga's strategic location and natural hot springs made it a popular rest stop for these feudal processions, leading to the development of a sophisticated hospitality infrastructure. The wealth generated by this traffic supported the growth of local crafts, including the famous Yamaga lantern tradition and umbrella production. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaga,_Kumamoto)

### Yamaga Lantern Craft Connection

The 600-year-old Yamaga lantern tradition represents one of Japan's most refined paper crafts, recognized as a National Traditional Craft in 2013. According to legend, Emperor Keiko's entourage was guided through heavy fog by villagers carrying torches, establishing a tradition of lantern offerings that evolved into an extraordinary craft form. [ðŸ”—](https://kumamoto.guide/en/season/detail/296)

Yamaga lanterns are crafted using only washi paper and small amounts of glue, without any wooden or metal fittingsâ€”a technique praised as the pinnacle of Japanese washi paper craftsmanship. During the Edo period, wealthy merchants patronized competitions among craftsmen, driving innovation and refinement in this art form. [ðŸ”—](https://explore-kumamoto.com/yamaga-lantern-museum/)

### "Little Kyoto" Designation

Yamaga has been recognized by the All Japan Kyoto Association for preserving traditional townscape character, earning designation as one of Japan's "Little Kyotos." This status reflects the town's success in maintaining Edo-period atmosphere while remaining a living community rather than simply a preserved museum district.
