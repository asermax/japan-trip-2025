AOYAGI (郷土料理 青柳 - Kyodo Ryori Aoyagi, meaning "Regional Cuisine Aoyagi") stands as one of Kumamoto's most respected traditional Japanese restaurants, having served authentic local cuisine for over 75 years since its establishment in 1949. Located in the heart of Kumamoto's bustling Shimotori shopping district, the restaurant occupies a five-story building featuring an elegant atmosphere with table seating and private rooms dressed in traditional Japanese style, complete with waitresses in kimono.

The restaurant's signature specialty is basashi (馬刺し - horse meat sashimi), representing Kumamoto's unique culinary heritage that traces back approximately 400 years to 1592, when Kato Kiyomasa, the first lord of the Higo Kumamoto domain, began consuming horse meat during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign in Korea. Today, Kumamoto prefecture accounts for 40% of Japan's horse meat production, making it the undisputed leader in both production and consumption of this delicacy.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

AOYAGI's basashi represents the pinnacle of Kumamoto's horse meat tradition. The restaurant serves premium marbled basashi featuring multiple cuts including Akami (lean meat), Harami (belly), Nakaochi (back), and liver - each offering distinct textures and flavors described by diners as "very tender and melts in your mouth." The basashi is presented artfully arranged on shiso leaves and onion slices, garnished with grated garlic and ginger. The traditional Kumamoto-style preparation pairs the tender, pink-hued meat (nicknamed "sakura" or cherry blossom meat for its color) with sweet Kumamoto soy sauce.

## The Dining Experience

**How to Properly Eat Basashi:**

1. **Condiment Preparation:** Place sweet Kumamoto soy sauce in a small dish. Add sliced or grated garlic and ginger to taste - many locals prefer a 1:1 ratio, though you can adjust to preference. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kyushu/kumamoto/basashi/)

2. **Assembly:** Place a slice of basashi on the provided shiso leaf with onion, then top with your garlic-ginger mixture. [🔗](https://japan-kyushu.com/eat/basashi-fresh-horse-sashimi/)

3. **Serving Temperature:** Basashi is served cold (near-frozen in the middle) and should be consumed immediately as horse fat has a low melting point. [🔗](https://www.halfwayanywhere.com/asia/japan/basashi-eating-raw-horse-meat/) [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/)

4. **Cutting Preference:** Request thin slices when ordering - the thicker the cut, the chewier the texture. Thin slices provide the signature "melt in your mouth" experience. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/horse-sashimi/)

5. **Traditional Pairing:** Small cups of warm sake traditionally accompany basashi. [🔗](https://www.halfwayanywhere.com/asia/japan/basashi-eating-raw-horse-meat/)

Following traditional Japanese sukiyaki etiquette, diners cook the meat at their table and dip it in fresh raw egg, creating a rich, luxurious coating.

**Cultural Context:**

Horse meat consumption in Kumamoto carries deep historical and cultural significance. Today, Kumamoto enforces strict safety standards for serving raw horse meat - typically flash-frozen to -20°C for at least 48 hours to eliminate parasites, with only certified restaurants permitted to serve it. Horse meat is nutritionally exceptional: very low in fat, high in protein, low in calories, and rich in iron.
