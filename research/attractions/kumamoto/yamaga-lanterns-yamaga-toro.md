Yamaga Toro are extraordinary paper lanterns representing one of Japan's most refined traditional crafts. These remarkable creations are made entirely from washi (handmade Japanese paper) and small amounts of glue, with no wood or metal fittings whatsoever. [ðŸ”—](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/yamagatoro/) The lanterns are lightweight, hollow structures that can range from simple designs to elaborate architectural models of real buildings such as the Yachiyoza Theater, famous shrines, and temples.

On December 26, 2013, Yamaga Toro received official designation as a Traditional Craft under the Act on the Promotion of Traditional Craft Industries by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry - the 218th such designation in Japan and the fourth in Kumamoto Prefecture.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The craft has legendary origins dating back to Emperor Keiko in the first and second centuries CE. According to the founding legend, the imperial retinue of Emperor Keiko, the 12th legendary sovereign, was brought to a standstill by heavy fog while traveling along the Kikuchi River. The villagers of Yamaga went out to guide the procession with torches, and this act of kindness evolved into the tradition of making paper lanterns during the Muromachi Era (1333-1573).

The creation of these lanterns requires extraordinary skill and dedication. To become a lantern maker (toro-shi), a craftsman must spend about ten years mastering high-level techniques and skills. [ðŸ”—](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/yamagatoro/) Today, there are only six lantern makers and three apprentices producing Yamaga Toro, making this an exceptionally rare craft.
