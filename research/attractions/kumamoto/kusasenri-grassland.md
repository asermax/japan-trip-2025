Kusasenri (草千里ヶ浜, Kusasenri-ga-hama) is a vast, picturesque grassy plain within the Aso caldera, one of the world's largest volcanic calderas. What remains of a volcanic crater on the northern slope of Mount Eboshidake, this emerald grassland spans 785,000 square meters at an elevation of 1,140 meters above sea level. [🔗](https://kumamoto.guide/en/spots/detail/210) The site was created by a volcanic eruption approximately 30,000 years ago and has been transformed over the past millennium into a carefully managed cultural landscape that exemplifies sustainable agricultural practices. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Aso)

Kusasenri presents a striking juxtaposition of peaceful pastoral beauty against the dramatic backdrop of an active volcano. The roughly circular grassland basin contains two crater lakes formed from pooled rainwater, creating stunning reflections of the smoking Mount Nakadake in the distance. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kusasenri-plateau/)

This is not a wild, untamed landscape but rather a meticulously maintained "secondary grassland" - a living example of sustainable human-environment interaction that has been practiced for over 1,000 years. The grasslands are mentioned in the Kojiki, Japan's oldest extant chronicle from the 8th century, indicating that local residents were already managing these lands since at least that period. [🔗](https://www.aso-denku.jp/english/2023/03/controlled-burnings-history-strenches-back-1000years/)

## Cultural and Agricultural Significance

The grassland is designated as a National Place of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monument, and is a key component of the Aso region's recognition as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. [🔗](https://www.fao.org/giahs/giahs-around-the-world/japan-aso-grasslands-sustainable-agriculture/en)

The Aso grasslands represent a sophisticated circular agricultural system recognized by UNESCO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System in 2013. [🔗](https://www.gov-online.go.jp/eng/publicity/book/hlj/html/202108/202108_12_en.html) This traditional system includes:

- **Grazing:** Vast pastures for the region's famous Akaushi (Japanese Brown) cattle and horses
- **Sustainable harvesting:** Grass cut in autumn for livestock fodder and bedding
- **Composting:** Animal manure mixed with harvested grass creates rich fertilizer for rice paddies
- **Thatching materials:** Susuki (Japanese pampas grass) used for traditional thatched-roof construction across Japan

The most crucial practice is **noyaki** (野焼き), controlled burning conducted annually from mid-February through March. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/noyaki-aso-grassland-burning/) This thousand-year-old tradition serves multiple purposes:
- Prevents forestation and maintains open grassland
- Eliminates ticks and pests harmful to livestock
- Returns nutrients to the volcanic ash soil
- Promotes fresh grass growth for spring grazing

Remarkably, research shows that noyaki is carbon-negative - the amount of CO2 that remains as ash exceeds the amount released during burning. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/plan-your-visit/guides-and-stories/yamayaki-controlled-burns-keep-grassland-ecosystems-balance/)

- Follow all safety instructions at viewing areas [🔗](https://www.klook.com/destination/p50290881-mount-aso/)

## Integration with Other Locations

Kusasenri serves as the natural centerpiece of a Mount Aso exploration itinerary. The location provides:

**Geographic Connection:** Positioned between the valley floor (Aso city/Aso Shrine area) and the mountain summit (Nakadake crater area), making it a convenient midpoint stop when traveling by bus or car.

**Cultural Context:** Complements understanding gained at Aso Shrine about the region's spiritual and agricultural traditions. The grassland demonstrates the practical application of sustainable land management mentioned in cultural heritage sites.

**Volcanic Landscape Progression:** After viewing the active Nakadake crater up close, Kusasenri offers perspective on how volcanic activity shaped the broader landscape and enabled unique ecosystems.

**Day Trip Structure:** Easily combines with Daikanbo Observatory (morning caldera views) → Kusasenri (midday exploration) → Nakadake Crater (afternoon visit, weather permitting) → Aso Shrine (late afternoon/evening) route.

### Nearby Attractions

**Within Aso Caldera:**
- **Nakadake Crater:** Active volcanic crater with viewing platforms (subject to volcanic activity levels)
- **Aso Shrine:** Important Shinto shrine in the valley (undergoing earthquake reconstruction)
- **Daikanbo Observatory:** Panoramic views of the entire Aso caldera and five peaks
- **Aso Farmland:** Themed park with hot springs and accommodation
- **Komezuka:** Perfect cone-shaped volcanic hill

## Important Notes

### Volcanic Activity Monitoring

Mount Aso is an active volcano with ongoing monitoring. Volcanic alert levels can change, affecting access to Nakadake crater and surrounding areas. While Kusasenri itself is at a safe distance, check current conditions at the Mount Aso Visitor Center website or contact them before your visit. [🔗](https://aso-visitorcenter.com/english/)

### Accessibility Considerations

The grassland walking paths are relatively flat but consist of natural grass and dirt surfaces that may be uneven or wet. The terrain is generally accessible for moderate mobility levels but may challenge wheelchair users or those with significant mobility limitations. The Aso Volcano Museum and facilities have paved access.

### Horse Riding Availability

Horseback riding operates from early March to mid-December, so it should be available for your November 1 visit. However, confirm availability on the day as weather conditions may affect operations. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12797/)

### Bus Schedule Dependency

Public transportation to Kusasenri operates on limited schedules (1-2 hour intervals). Missing a bus could significantly impact your itinerary. Note the return bus times immediately upon arrival and plan your activities accordingly. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4552.html)

### The Living Cultural Landscape

Understanding that Kusasenri represents a thousand-year partnership between humans and nature fundamentally enhances the visiting experience. This is not pristine wilderness but a UNESCO-recognized example of sustainable agricultural heritage facing modern challenges as farming populations decline. Your visit helps raise awareness of the importance of preserving these traditional practices. [🔗](https://www.fao.org/giahs/giahs-around-the-world/japan-aso-grasslands-sustainable-agriculture/en)
