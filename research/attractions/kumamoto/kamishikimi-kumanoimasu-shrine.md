Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine is a mystical Shinto shrine hidden among cypress forests in Takamori, at the foot of Mount Aso in Kumamoto Prefecture. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamishikimi_Kumanoimasu_Shrine) The shrine is renowned for its atmospheric approach path featuring approximately 100 moss-covered stone lanterns lining 270 steep stone steps through a cathedral-like cedar forest. [🔗](https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/see-and-do/spots/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

The shrine is believed to have been founded between the late Kamakura Period (1185) and the Muromachi Period (1573), established through a combination of ancient rock formation worship centered on Kakutoiwa and Kumano worship brought by Shugenja (mountain ascetic) believers. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/) The current main hall was reconstructed in 1722 after the original structure was destroyed in the 16th century. [🔗](https://jintravelsjapan.blogspot.com/2025/03/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine.html)

The shrine worships three primary deities: Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto, the divine creator couple from Japanese mythology who created the islands of Japan and many other kami, making this a popular destination for those seeking blessings for marriage and harmonious relationships. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/) The shrine is part of the network of approximately 3,000 Kumano shrines across Japan, connected to the main Kumano Sanzan (Three Grand Shrines of Kumano) in the Kii Mountains.

The shrine gained significant popularity after serving as the setting for the 2011 anime film "Hotarubi no Mori e" (Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light), based on manga by Yuki Midorikawa. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamishikimi_Kumanoimasu_Shrine) The shrine also appeared in the film "Rurouni Kenshin: The Final," further cementing its status as an anime pilgrimage destination. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Ancient Kumano Worship

Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine represents the spread of Kumano worship from the sacred Kii Mountains to Kyushu. The shrine is part of a network of approximately 3,000 Kumano shrines across Japan, all connected to the main Kumano Sanzan (Three Grand Shrines of Kumano). This connection makes Kamishikimi a regional outpost of one of Japan's most important spiritual traditions, bringing the sacred power of the Kumano deities to the Aso region. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)

### The Divine Creator Couple

The shrine's dedication to Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto holds special significance in Japanese mythology. These two deities created the islands of Japan and gave birth to countless other kami (Shinto gods), making them the primordial parents of the Japanese archipelago and its divine inhabitants. Their union represents the sacred balance of masculine and feminine energies, making the shrine a popular destination for those seeking blessings for marriage, harmonious relationships, and fertility.

Small Nagi trees (Asian Bayberry) are planted on the left and right of the prayer hall, symbolizing the divine couple and unbreakable relationships. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

### Power Spot Designation

The shrine is recognized as a powerful *reiki supotto* (power spot) where visitors can feel concentrated spiritual energy from the natural environment. The combination of ancient cedar forest, sacred rock formations, moss-covered lanterns, and centuries of worship creates an atmosphere believed to have healing and rejuvenating effects. Many visitors report feeling a palpable change in energy as they ascend the stone steps, describing the experience as deeply peaceful and spiritually renewing. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12863/)

### Ugeto Stone Legend

Behind the main hall stands Ugeto-iwa, a massive rock formation with a 10-meter-wide hole through its center. According to legend, this hole was kicked through the solid rock by Kihachi, a follower of the god Takeiwatatsu-no-mikoto who created Mount Aso, as he fled from his pursuers. [🔗](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/gb/japan-travel-planner/kumamoto/0000011.html) The stone has become a powerful symbol of overcoming obstacles, with the belief that if creating this hole is possible, then any difficulty can be overcome. It is particularly revered for bringing luck in passing examinations and achieving victory. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)

### Anime Pilgrimage Site

The shrine gained international recognition after serving as the setting for "Hotarubi no Mori e" (Into the Forest of Fireflies' Light), a 2011 anime film about the friendship between a young girl, Hotaru, and a mysterious boy in a cat mask, Gin, unfolding in the cypress forest leading to the shrine. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine-aso/) The film's poignant story and beautiful depiction of the shrine's atmospheric setting have made it a pilgrimage destination for anime fans worldwide. The shrine also appeared in "Rurouni Kenshin: The Final," further cementing its cultural significance in contemporary Japanese media.

## The Shrine Experience

### The Sacred Approach Path

The experience begins as you cross the road and enter the first torii gate, immediately transported to a green and sacred space. The approach consists of approximately 270 steep stone steps (some sources cite 260-300 steps total) winding through towering cedar and cypress trees. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/) Nearly 100 moss-covered stone lanterns (toro) line both sides of the staircase, creating an otherworldly atmosphere as they guide visitors on a physical and spiritual journey from the mundane world to the sacred realm. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)

On clear days, rays of sunlight filter through the forest canopy to the walkway, creating an epic backdrop for photography. In rain or mist, the atmosphere becomes even more mystical and magical. [🔗](https://japan-documented.com/culture/shinto-shrine/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

### Main Shrine (Honden)

After climbing approximately 250 steps, you reach the main worship hall where you can pray to Izanagi and Izanami for blessings in relationships, marriage, and business prosperity. [🔗](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/gb/japan-travel-planner/kumamoto/0000011.html) Small Nagi trees (Asian Bayberry) are planted on the left and right of the prayer hall, symbolizing the divine couple and unbreakable relationships. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

### Ugeto Stone (Ugeto-iwa)

Behind the main hall, another path with approximately 50 additional steps leads to the most powerful sacred object: Ugeto-iwa, a massive rock formation with a 10-meter-wide hole through its center. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)

According to legend, this hole was kicked through the solid rock by Kihachi, a follower of the god Takeiwatatsu-no-mikoto who created Mount Aso, as he fled from his pursuers. [🔗](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/gb/japan-travel-planner/kumamoto/0000011.html) The stone has become a powerful symbol of overcoming obstacles, with the belief that if creating this hole is possible, then any difficulty can be overcome. It is particularly revered for bringing luck in passing examinations and achieving victory. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Cultural Etiquette

**Approach Path:** Walk on the sides of the path rather than the center, which is reserved for the kami (spirits).

**Purification:** Before praying, purify your hands and mouth at the water basin (chozuya): [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)
1. Hold the ladle with your right hand and pour water over your left
2. Switch hands and pour water over your right
3. Pour water into your cupped left hand and rinse your mouth (do not drink from ladle)
4. Tilt the ladle to let remaining water cleanse the handle

**Prayer:** At the main hall, offer a coin (5-yen coins are considered lucky, as "go-en" means "good fortune" or "good connection"), ring the bell if available, bow twice, clap twice, offer a silent prayer, then bow once more. [🔗](https://offbeatjapan.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shinto-shrine-powerspot/)

**Respect Sacred Space:** This is an active place of worship. Keep noise to a minimum and visit with a thankful heart and pure spirit. [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

### November Visit Considerations

**Autumn Foliage:** November falls in early autumn, one of the best times to visit with stunning fall foliage enhancing the mystical atmosphere of the cedar forest. [🔗](https://thefroggyadventures.com/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

**Weather:** November often brings misty mornings and occasional rain, which actually enhance the shrine's magical atmosphere rather than diminish it. The moss-covered lanterns and ancient trees create an even more mystical experience in these conditions. [🔗](https://japan-documented.com/culture/shinto-shrine/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

**Crowds:** November is less crowded than peak tourist seasons, though weekends may see bus tour groups. Visiting on weekday mornings provides the most peaceful experience. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)

**What to Wear:** Comfortable walking shoes (sneakers, not sandals) are essential for the steep stone steps. Prepare for cool temperatures and possible rain typical of November in the Aso region. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)

### Best Photo Spots

**Photography Tips:**
- Halfway up the staircase looking upward through the lanterns and cedar canopy
- Looking down from near the main shrine toward the torii gate entrance
- Close-up shots of moss-covered lanterns
- The Ugeto Stone's dramatic hole with forest background
- Early morning when mist creates atmospheric lighting

**For rainy weather:** Use a wide-angle lens for moody shots and crouch low aiming upward to capture the full scale of the scene. On clear days, mid-day lighting provides the best illumination through the forest canopy. [🔗](https://japan-documented.com/culture/shinto-shrine/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/)

### Crowd Avoidance Strategies

Visit on weekday mornings for the most peaceful experience and best opportunity for uninterrupted photography. [🔗](https://japan-documented.com/culture/shinto-shrine/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine/) Avoid weekends and holidays when tour buses bring larger groups. Even when crowded, the shrine maintains a calm, mystical atmosphere. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)

### Physical Requirements

The climb involves approximately 270 steep stone steps. While described as "a light climb," visitors should have moderate fitness levels. The steps can be slippery when wet. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/171500/kamishikimi-kumanoimasu-shrine)
