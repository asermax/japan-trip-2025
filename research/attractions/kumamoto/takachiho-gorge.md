Takachiho Gorge is a narrow chasm cut through volcanic basalt rock by the Gokase River over 100,000 years ago following eruptions from nearby Mount Aso. The gorge features column-shaped basalt cliffs reaching 80-100 meters in height, stretching for 7 kilometers along the river. [🔗](https://visitmiyazaki.com/place_to_go/takachiho-gorge/) The nearly sheer cliffs are formed from volcanic basalt columns which resemble dragon scales where the stone twisted and flowed as it cooled and formed. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e8052.html)

The gorge's centerpiece is the 17-meter high Manai Falls (Minainotaki), cascading from Onokoro Pond above the cliffs into the emerald-green river below. Manai Falls is designated as one of Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls, creating a stunning white cascade that resembles a graceful serpent flowing into the gorge.

## Cultural & Mythological Significance

Takachiho holds extraordinary significance in Japanese mythology as the legendary birthplace of Japan. This is the site where the sun goddess Amaterasu, the highest deity in Japanese mythology and queen of the kami (divine beings), hid in a cave (Amano Iwato) to escape her brother Susanoo's violent rampage, plunging both heaven and earth into darkness. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/) The Japanese Imperial family claims direct descent from Amaterasu's lineage, making this area central to Japan's cultural and spiritual identity. [🔗](https://www.his-usa.com/destination-japan/miyazaki/takachiho.html)

According to legend, eight million deities convened at the nearby riverbank to devise a solution to lure Amaterasu from her hiding place. They performed ritualistic dances and created such joyous commotion that the curious goddess emerged, restoring light to the world. [🔗](https://www.jal.co.jp/at/en/guide-to-japan/itinerary/miyazaki/takachiho/index.html)

Another foundational myth tells of Ninigi-no-Mikoto, Amaterasu's grandson, descending to earth in Takachiho carrying the divine mandate that began the lineage of Japan's emperors. [🔗](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/travel/guide-to-takachiho-in-miyazaki-discover-the-birthplace-of-japanese-mythology/)

This mythological heritage has been preserved through Yokagura, ritualistic dance performances that have been a Shinto tradition for over 800 years, reenacting the story of Amaterasu each night during the clear midwinter season from November to early February.

**November-Specific Booking Considerations:**

**Early November (November 1st):**
- Foliage season just beginning - colors developing but not yet at peak
- Peak foliage typically occurs mid-to-late November through early December in Kyushu [🔗](https://matcha-jp.com/en/2720)
- November 1st visit will show early autumn colors but vibrant reds and oranges develop later in the month
- Competition for bookings increases as month progresses toward peak foliage
- November marked as high season for autumn foliage [🔗](https://explore-kumamoto.com/takachiho-boating/)

- Weekend slots book out fastest
- Morning slots (9:00-11:00 AM) most competitive due to optimal lighting

**November Weather Considerations:**
- Temperature: Daytime 15-17°C (59-63°F), Morning/Evening 5-6°C (41-43°F)
- Rainfall: Moderate precipitation (approximately 92mm for month)
- Rain expected 10-12 days during November [🔗](https://weather-and-climate.com/takachiho-miyazaki-jp-November-averages)

2. **Check website at 8:00 AM** for same-day availability status
3. **Target 10:00-11:00 AM slots** if available
4. **Expect wait times:** 30 minutes to 2 hours reported [🔗](https://serenaslenses.net/day-trip-to-takachiho-gorge-kyushu/)
