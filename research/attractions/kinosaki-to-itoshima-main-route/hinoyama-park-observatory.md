**CRITICAL CLOSURE - OCTOBER 2025 VISIT NOT POSSIBLE**

Hinoyama Park (火の山公園) sits atop Mount Hinoyama at 268 meters elevation in Shimonoseki, part of the Setonaikai National Park. However, **the park is closed through October 31, 2025** due to the "Hikari no Yama (Light of the Mountain) Project" renovation work. [🔗](https://www.city.shimonoseki.lg.jp/soshiki/76/121993)

The Hinoyama Parkway access road has been closed since March 1, 2025, preventing all vehicle access to the summit during the planned October 30 visit date. The ropeway service was also discontinued on November 10, 2024, with replacement facilities not scheduled until fiscal year 2026 or later. [🔗](https://shimonoseki.travel/post-2964)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Established as an urban planning park in 1948 and incorporated into the Setonaikai National Park in 1956, Hinoyama has offered panoramic views of the Kanmon Strait for nearly seven decades. [🔗](https://yamaguchi-tourism.jp/spot/detail_15277.html)

The site carries deep historical significance as a military fortification. During the Meiji era, the Choshu domain established an artillery battery here, and giant nineteenth-century cannons are still displayed in the park as remnants of the old defense installations. The park overlooks the historic Dannoura battlefield where the Battle of Dan-no-ura was fought in 1185, marking the end of the Genpei War and establishing the first samurai government in Japan.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Alternative Kanmon Strait Viewpoints (October 2025)

Since Hinoyama Park is closed during the planned visit, consider these accessible alternatives:

- **Mekari Parking Area Observatory:** Observation deck on Kyushu Expressway with sunset views of Kanmon Bridge and strait
- **Dannoura Parking Area:** Honshu side expressway observation deck (downbound only)
- **Kaikyo Yume Tower:** 153m observation tower with 360-degree views (¥300 with passport discount)
- **Mojiko Retro Observation Room:** 103m tower in Kitakyushu with strait panoramas (¥300 admission)
- **Kanmon Pedestrian Tunnel:** Unique undersea crossing experience (780m walk, 15-20 minutes, free)

### Future Visit Planning (Post-October 2025)

When the park reopens:
- Arrive 1 hour before sunset for golden hour photography
- Stay after dark for illuminated bridge views
- Weekday mornings typically quietest
- Free admission and parking make this budget-friendly
- Bring windbreaker - winds can be strong at 268m elevation
- Stay on designated paths due to wildlife (wild boars present)

### Route Integration

**October 30, 2025:** This location cannot be included in the route due to closure. Use alternative Kanmon Strait viewpoints listed above.

**Future Reference:** When reopened, Hinoyama would serve as an ideal morning or late afternoon stop when traveling the Kanmon Strait crossing, offering panoramic context before or after the bridge/tunnel crossing experience.
