Known as "The Kitchen of Kitakyushu," Tanga Market is a century-old traditional market that represents authentic local food culture and retro Showa-era atmosphere. Established around 1913-1914 along the banks of the Kantake River (a tributary of the Murasaki River), the market originated when sardine fishermen from the Genkai Sea began unloading and selling their catch directly from boats moored at the riverside.

This unique positioning makes Tanga Market the only market in Japan built on top of a river, giving it distinctive character and historical significance. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/13182) During the Taisho Period (1912-1926), vegetable sellers from the region began gathering alongside the fish merchants, establishing the market's reputation as the comprehensive food source for Kitakyushu residents.

The market retains a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of Japan's post-war Showa era (1926-1989), with approximately 90-120 shops packed into a 180-meter-long covered arcade. The narrow lanes are filled with vendors selling fresh fish, seasonal vegetables, meat, prepared foods, and local specialties. [ðŸ”—](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12888)

**Important Current Status:** Two significant fires struck Tanga Market in April and August 2022, destroying over 80 stores. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/news/second-fire-in-4-months-at-tanga-market-in-kitakyushu/) The undamaged portions have reopened, and many displaced shops operate from temporary structures including the "Tanga Renga Hiroba" (Tanga Brick Plaza) and "Tanga Open-Air Market." [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4884.html) Reconstruction is underway with a modern commercial complex expected by fiscal year 2030.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Tanga Market represents over a century of Kitakyushu's culinary heritage and traditional market culture. Its origin story as a riverside fish market directly connected to the Genkai Sea fishing industry makes it a living testament to the region's maritime traditions. The market's evolution through the Taisho Period into a comprehensive food market reflects the economic development and urbanization of Northern Kyushu during Japan's industrial growth.

The preservation of Showa-era market practices and atmosphere provides an authentic glimpse into mid-20th century Japanese daily life, a cultural experience increasingly rare in modern Japan. The market's resilience through two devastating fires and its ongoing reconstruction demonstrates the deep community connection and cultural value placed on this historic institution.

**Popular toppings include:** Fresh sashimi, nukamisodaki (local specialty - see below), tempura, grilled Nambanzuke-style whale, yakitori, and various seasonal vegetables and seafood.

### Nukamisodaki (Nuka-taki): Local Specialty

This quintessential Kitakyushu dish represents the market's culinary heritage. Sardines, mackerel, or other bluefish are simmered for hours in a special nuka-doko (fermented rice bran pickling bed), soy sauce, and spices. The long cooking process makes the fish tender enough to eat whole, including bones. [ðŸ”—](https://skyticket.com/guide/66061)

Some historic shops use nuka-doko maintained and passed down for over a century, with each generation adding to the complex fermented flavors.
