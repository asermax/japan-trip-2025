## Basic Information

Itonowa (ç³¸å³¶ï½žé™¶èŠ¸ä½“é¨“itonowa/ã‚¤ãƒˆãƒŽãƒ¯) is a pottery workshop in the Sakurai area offering hands-on ceramic experiences using hand-wheel (te-rokuro) and slab-building (tatara) techniques. The workshop owner trained under Okamoto Kozan of Chikuzen Noma-yaki and Takatori Kosen of Takatori-yaki (traditional Fukuoka pottery styles), relocating to Itoshima from Fukuoka City in 2006.

Participants can create tea bowls, cups, plates, or small vases using 12 types of glazes, with pieces fired in a traditional kerosene kiln. The workshop welcomes children as young as 3 years old, making it family-friendly. [ðŸ”—](https://www.jalan.net/kankou/spt_guide000000181831/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Connection to Kyushu Ceramic Traditions

Itonowa represents a bridge between Kyushu's centuries-old ceramic heritage and contemporary Itoshima craft culture. The owner's training in established traditions (Takatori-yaki and Chikuzen Noma-yaki) before establishing an independent studio brings technical expertise while developing a personal artistic voice. [ðŸ”—](https://activityjapan.com/publish/feature/5688)

This pattern reflects how Itoshima's ceramic community evolvedâ€”individual artisans with formal training choosing to establish studios in this scenic coastal region, creating a collaborative creative community rather than adhering to a single traditional style.

### Wabi-Sabi in Practice

Japanese pottery embraces wabi-sabi philosophyâ€”finding beauty in imperfection, asymmetry, and natural variation. In your workshop experience:
- Irregular shapes are celebrated, not corrected
- Uneven textures add character
- "Mistakes" become unique features
- Kiln firing creates unpredictable variations ("keshiki" or landscapes)
- Each piece tells the story of its creation [ðŸ”—](Gemini research)
