Yashinoki Blanco (Palm Tree Swings) is a modern seaside athletic park and Instagram-famous photo spot located on the grounds of Zauo Honten restaurant on the eastern coast of Itoshima Peninsula. This contemporary installation features various swing types between palm trees with the ocean as a dramatic backdrop, making it one of Itoshima's most photogenic spots. [ðŸ”—](https://kanko-itoshima.jp/spot/yashinoki-zauo/)

The palm tree swing became popular as a modern installation using two naturally-leaning palm trees on a beautiful sandy beach with the Genkai Sea stretching to the horizon, creating the illusion of flying over the ocean when swinging. The location has evolved into a small beachside park featuring multiple swing types including the iconic palm tree swing, heart-shaped swings, pirate swings, five-seater swings, and double-decker swings, plus photo props like a climbing wall, spinning pull-up bar, mini flying fox swing, neon pink door installation, white staircase overlooking the sea, and Jaws motif sculpture.

The spot fits perfectly into Itoshima's relaxed coastal culture, which has attracted a community drawn to a "slow life" lifestyle centered around nature, surfing, and artistic expression. The peninsula hosts over 100 artist studios and galleries and the biennial Itoshima Arts Farm international art festival.

## Cultural & Artistic Significance

Yashinoki Blanco represents contemporary Itoshima coastal culture and the area's creative, relaxed lifestyle rather than ancient traditions. The installation complements the peninsula's thriving artist community and reflects the region's evolution as a destination for creative entrepreneurs seeking a slower-paced life connected to nature and the sea.

In summer, the area features BBQ facilities with upbeat music and lively beach atmosphere. However, November offers a quieter, more serene experience with pleasant weather and spectacular sunset lighting conditions ideal for photography.

## The Experience

### Photography Opportunities

The main attraction is taking memorable photos on various swings with the expansive Genkai Sea backdrop. The iconic palm tree swing creates the illusion of flying over the ocean when captured at the right angle. When swinging at full height (approximately 6 meters), the perspective makes it appear as though you're soaring above the water. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/place-master/13318/)

Additional photo opportunities include heart-shaped swing for romantic shots, five-seater swing for group photos, double-decker and pirate-themed swings for variety, hammock swing for relaxed poses, neon pink door installation standing in the sand, white staircase overlooking the sea, and Jaws sculpture with opened mouth. [ðŸ”—](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/4860260/zauo-main-store)

### Beach Activities and Dining

Beyond photography, visitors can play on various athletic equipment including climbing walls and spinning bars, enjoy the mini flying fox swing, relax on the sandy beach, watch the sunset over the Genkai Sea, and explore the "miracle driftwood" that washed ashore. [ðŸ”—](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/4860260/zauo-main-store)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Best Timing

**Late afternoon/sunset:** Arrive 1-2 hours before sunset (approximately 5:15-5:30 PM in early November) for best lighting conditions. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

**Weekdays preferred:** Significantly fewer people than weekends. Early morning right after opening offers nearly empty beach. Avoid weekend afternoons and holidays when queues form. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japantriptips.com/itoshima-come-for-the-white-sand-beaches-stay-for-the-artsy-workshops/)

### Photography Strategy

Bring wide-angle lens for ocean expanse, use continuous shooting mode for action swing shots, experiment with different angles and swing heights, consider tripod for sunset long exposures. Main palm tree swing: position at full swing height for "flying over ocean" effect. Heart-shaped swing: best for couples or romantic shots. White staircase: captures ocean panorama backdrop. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/place-master/13318/)

### Cultural Etiquette

Queue patiently during busy times without rushing others. Keep noise levels moderate to maintain peaceful beach atmosphere. Leave no trace - take all trash with you. Respect restaurant property - be mindful of patrons. Share equipment - don't monopolize swings during busy periods. Simple Japanese greetings appreciated: "Konnichiwa" (hello) or "Arigatou gozaimasu" (thank you). Be conscious of others waiting for photos. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japantriptips.com/itoshima-come-for-the-white-sand-beaches-stay-for-the-artsy-workshops/)

### November Preparation

Light jacket or windbreaker for coastal breezes, comfortable walking shoes suitable for sand, sunglasses for bright afternoon light, camera/phone protective case for beach environment, light layers you can adjust as temperature changes throughout the day. November offers excellent sunset photography conditions with clear, crisp ocean views without summer haze, warm golden-hour lighting, less harsh midday sun, and dramatic atmospheric conditions. [ðŸ”—](https://www.agatetravel.com/japan/fukuoka/weather-in-november.html)

### Money-Saving Options

Swings completely free to use. Parking free with Â¥3,000+ restaurant purchase (essentially free parking if dining). No admission or facility fees. [ðŸ”—](https://kanko-itoshima.jp/spot/yashinoki-zauo/)

### Nearby Integration

**Itoshima Coastal Loop:** Morning at Sakurai Futamigaura and white torii gate, late morning/lunch at palm tree swings with optional lunch at Zauo Honten, afternoon along Sunset Road exploring cafes and galleries, late afternoon return to Futamigaura or another sunset spot. [ðŸ”—](https://heyroseanne.com/sakurai-futamigaura/)

**November Oyster Season Circuit:** Visit swings in late afternoon for photos, head to nearby kakigoya for early dinner (arrive before 6 PM for best availability), enjoy sunset views while grilling fresh oysters. November marks the start of Itoshima's famous winter oyster season (October-March) with 26 kakigoya across five fishing ports offering Â¥1,200/kg (~11-12 oysters) of fresh Itoshima oysters known for milky sweetness. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

### Important Considerations

Photo queues may form on weekends (5-10 minutes per group). Bus service runs only once per hour - car rental most practical for flexible scheduling. As outdoor beach location, experience is weather-dependent (check forecasts for wind and rain). This is a modern Instagram installation rather than historical/cultural site. Consider parking duration when planning total visit time. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/place-master/13318/) [ðŸ”—](https://itoshima.xyz/872.html)
