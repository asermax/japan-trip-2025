Studio Kura is one of Japan's most active international artist-in-residence programs, bringing approximately 10 artists monthly from Asia, Europe, and America to rural Itoshima since 2007. The program utilizes three traditional Japanese rural houses in the Futamigaura area as facilities, where artists live while creating and interacting with local people. [üîó](https://studiokura.info/en/)

Founded by artist Hirofumi Matsuzaki, who studied contemporary art in Germany before returning to his family home in Itoshima, the program has grown from a single renovated rice storehouse (kura) into a comprehensive arts complex. The facilities include traditional buildings over 100 years old, located in a quiet residential area near rice fields with mountain views.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### International Cultural Exchange

Studio Kura's motto, "Disseminating culture from Itoshima to the world!", reflects its dual mission of providing artists with an authentic rural Japanese experience while enriching the local community with international contemporary art. Each residency (four, eight, or twelve weeks) concludes with a required exhibition, creating a continuous cycle of fresh artistic perspectives. [üîó](https://studiokura.info/en/)

The program has earned significant recognition, with founder Matsuzaki receiving the Fukuoka Prefecture Culture Award. Beyond the residency, Studio Kura operates a FabLab equipped with digital fabrication tools, teaches art to all ages, and organizes the biennial Itoshima International Art Festival (Itoshima Arts Farm).
