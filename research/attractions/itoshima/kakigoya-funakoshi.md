Funakoshi Fishing Port hosts seven seasonal oyster huts (kakigoya) that operate from October through April, representing the heart of northern Kyushu's distinctive kakigoya culture. This winter tradition invites visitors to grill fresh oysters and seafood themselves in rustic, harbor-side huts run directly by local fishing families and cooperatives. All seven huts underwent complete renovation in 2022, creating modern facilities while maintaining the authentic atmosphere that defines the kakigoya experience.

Funakoshi holds special significance in Itoshima's maritime heritage, boasting the largest catch of wild sea bream in all of Japan.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Kakigoya Tradition

Kakigoya represents the evolution of hamayaki (beach grilling), where local fishermen historically grilled their fresh catch directly on the beach. What began as practical fishermen's meals has transformed into a beloved winter ritual, with temporary greenhouse-like structures erected each autumn along the coastline of Itoshima's fishing ports. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

The kakigoya culture embodies the Japanese concept of *shun* (æ—¬) - celebrating ingredients at their seasonal peak - while offering an interactive, communal dining experience that contrasts with more formal Japanese culinary traditions. These huts operate seasonally from late October to early April, operated directly by fishermen and fishing cooperatives who harvest oysters from the nutrient-rich waters of the Genkai Sea, considered one of Japan's finest fishing grounds.

### Funakoshi's Maritime Heritage

In 2022, Funakoshi transformed into Western Japan's largest kakigoya cluster with total seating capacity exceeding 1,400 people and extensive free parking for approximately 200 cars. The port's traditional fishing practices, including sustainable wild sea bream harvesting and traditional squid fishing methods, connect visitors directly to Itoshima's living maritime culture.
