Anego no Hama (姉子の浜) is an arch-shaped beach stretching 1.1 kilometers in length and 20 meters in width, formed by the raging waves of the Genkai Sea along the Itoshima Peninsula coast. [🔗](https://itoshima-now.com/en/places/anego-no-hama/) [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/10252)

The beach is famous for its rare "nakisuna" (鳴き砂) or "singing sand"—a distinctive squeaking sound produced when walking on the sand. This acoustic phenomenon is created by the friction of clean, uniform quartz grains rubbing together. The sand grains at Anego no Hama are relatively large at 0.3 millimeters in diameter and comprise approximately 80% quartz composition. The sand only "sings" when perfectly clean—any contamination from oil, ash, or litter silences the sound, making it a natural barometer of environmental health.

## Cultural & Environmental Significance

Anego no Hama holds profound cultural significance as an environmental success story. In the early 1960s, coastal pollution caused the sand to fall silent—an audible sign of degradation. However, through over 30 years of dedicated cleanup efforts by local citizens and a volunteer group called "Friends of Nakisuna at Anego-no-Hama," water quality improved dramatically. Around 1994, the sand began to "sing" again, making it the only singing sand beach in Japan to recover its acoustic properties after being silenced.

The beach was designated as a municipal natural monument in 1998 and is considered a "super first-class singing sand" beach—one of only approximately 20 remaining singing sand beaches nationwide (down from 90 historically). It stands as the only singing sand beach in Kyushu. [🔗](https://kanko-itoshima.jp/spot/anegonohama/)

The scientific explanation involves sand grains vibrating in unison, with thousands of small vibrations combining to push air together like a loudspeaker diaphragm, typically producing frequencies around 450 Hz.

## The Singing Sand Experience

### How to Experience the Phenomenon

To hear the sand "sing," follow these steps:

1. **Ensure dry conditions:** Visit on clear, sunny day after period without rain—sand must be completely dry
2. **Apply pressure:** Don't walk normally—shuffle feet firmly, grinding sand grains together
3. **Try twisting:** Twist heel into sand to generate friction needed for squeaking
4. **Listen:** You'll hear distinctive "kyukyu" (キュキュ) squeaking noise like rubber or cork being compressed

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Cultural Etiquette & Beach Protection

**Critical:** The singing sand phenomenon depends entirely on beach cleanliness. Visitors must:
- **Leave no trace:** Take all litter; even microscopic particles silence the sand
- **No spills:** Avoid drinks, food, or oils on sand as these coat quartz grains
- **Respect the monument:** Designated Prefectural Natural Monument—treat with reverence
- **Support preservation:** The "song" is maintained through community effort

### Visiting Strategy
- **Arrive early:** Limited parking (30 spaces) fills quickly on nice days
- **Check weather:** Singing sand only works when dry—rainy days won't produce sound
- **Remove shoes:** Best experienced barefoot to feel and hear phenomenon clearly
- **Combine sites:** Visit Futamigaura and other coastal attractions same trip
- **Use facilities:** Stock up at shop and use restrooms at parking area before beach visit
- **Plan for sunset:** If visiting late afternoon, stay for spectacular Genkai Sea sunset

### Photography Recommendations
- Elevated view from Nijo Parking Area showing beach's curved arc
- Beach level looking along 1.1 km shoreline
- Sunset shots with silhouettes against Genkai Sea horizon
- Close-up macro shots of white quartz sand texture

### Best Times
- **Morning:** Soft light on white sand
- **Sunset:** Dramatic coastal silhouettes (around 5:30 PM November)
- **Sunny Days:** Showcase white sand and blue Genkai Sea contrast
- **Side Lighting:** Morning/afternoon reveals sand texture better than midday
