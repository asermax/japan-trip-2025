The Shinmachi Dolmen Cluster (新町支石墓群, Shinmachi Shisekibo-gun) is a National Historic Site containing 57 burial graves from the early Yayoi period (approximately 2nd century BCE), representing one of the most significant archaeological sites in northern Kyushu. The site provides crucial evidence of cultural exchange between the Korean Peninsula and Japan during the adoption of rice cultivation and burial practices. [🔗](https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/207103)

Located on a sand dune facing Hikizu Bay on the southwest side of the Itoshima Peninsula, this archaeological site has been known since the early 20th century when Professor Heijiro Nakayama first introduced it to academic circles. The site gained national attention following its first full-scale excavation in 1986 by the Shima Town Board of Education. [🔗](https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/207103)

The excavation of approximately 300 square meters revealed 57 burial graves, including seven dolmen-style tombs (支石墓, shisekibo) with their massive upper capstones still in their original positions. These dolmens - stone burial structures featuring large flat stones supported by smaller standing stones - represent a burial practice widely used in Manchuria and Korea, demonstrating clear continental cultural influence during the Yayoi period.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Archaeological Significance

The Shinmachi site is particularly valuable for several groundbreaking discoveries:

**Evidence of Early Warfare:** Tomb No. 24 contained the skeletal remains of a middle-aged man with a Korean willow leaf-shaped polished stone arrowhead embedded in his left femur. This discovery, widely described as revealing "the first casualty of war in the Japanese archipelago," provides direct physical evidence of violent conflict during the early Yayoi period. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinmachi_Dolmen_Cluster)

**Cultural Transition Period:** The 14 sets of human bones excavated from the site show characteristics typical of Jomon people, including evidence of tooth extraction practices (a Jomon cultural tradition). However, recent 2023 analysis by Kyushu University suggests these remains fall within the range of "immigrant Yayoi people," challenging earlier interpretations and highlighting the complex nature of population transition during this period.

**Burial Practices:** The site demonstrates diverse burial methods including wooden coffin burials for adults (inferred from burial postures and coffin stand stones) and jar coffin burials (甕棺墓, kamekan-bo) for infants, revealing social and age-based burial distinctions in early agricultural society. [🔗](https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/207103)

### Connection to Itokoku Kingdom

The Shinmachi site is part of the broader archaeological landscape of ancient Itokoku (伊都国), one of the countries in Wa-koku mentioned in Chinese historical records such as the Wajinden. Itokoku is believed to have been located in what is now Itoshima City and surrounding areas during the Yayoi period (3rd century BCE - 3rd century CE). The presence of Korean-style dolmens, continental-style pottery, and evidence of rice cultivation at Shinmachi demonstrates Itokoku's role as a gateway for cultural transmission from the Korean Peninsula to the Japanese islands.

### Korean Peninsula Cultural Connections

The dolmen burial practice represents significant cultural exchange during the early Yayoi period. The Korean Peninsula is home to over 35,000 dolmens (approximately 40% of the world's total), constructed during the first millennium BCE as grave markers for the ruling elite. The presence of similar dolmens in Itoshima, along with Korean-style stone arrowheads and pottery similarities with southern Korea, indicates that Bronze Age culture from Manchuria and Korea crossed to the Japanese islands, bringing not only burial practices but also rice cultivation and bronze metallurgy.
