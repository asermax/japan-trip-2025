Shiraito Falls is a 24-meter-high waterfall located in southern Itoshima City, Fukuoka Prefecture, nestled at 530-900 meters above sea level on Haganeyama (Mount Hagane). The waterfall earned its name from its aesthetic appearance—flowing like delicate white silk threads down the rock face ("shiraito" means "white threads" in Japanese). The site is designated as an official Fukuoka Prefecture Scenic Spot and is recognized as a spiritual "power spot" believed to overflow with negative ions and healing natural energy.

Shiraito Falls presents a striking visual spectacle as water cascades 24 meters down the mountainside, creating the delicate appearance of flowing white silk threads that inspired its name. The waterfall is described by visitors as "breathtaking" with its pure white spray falling gracefully down the rock surface. Located in a pristine natural setting halfway up Haganeyama Mountain, the falls serve as both a scenic attraction and a spiritual destination. [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/10063)
