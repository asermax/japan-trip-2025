Kafuri Fishing Harbor hosts two well-established kakigoya: **Sumiyoshi-maru** and **Hiro-chan Kaki**. These seasonal establishments offer an immersive seafood dining experience deeply rooted in Itoshima's fishing culture, operating for approximately 20 years each. The establishments embody a direct "sea-to-shack" philosophy where oysters harvested from the harbor's offshore racks reach dining tables within hours.

The exceptional quality of Kafuri's oysters stems from the unique environment of the Genkai Sea. Rich nutrients flow from the Sefuri Mountains into the sea, encouraging high-quality plankton growth. The relatively cold, clean waters allow oysters to grow slowly, developing flavor that is exceptionally rich, creamy, and sweet with less brininess than oysters from other regions.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

Oyster farming in Itoshima follows a traditional six-month cycle: fishermen attach scallop shells with oyster seeds to floating racks around April or May, where the oysters feed on plankton until harvest in autumn. This tradition, gaining popularity around 1990, has become a defining winter attraction combining fresh seafood, interactive cooking, countryside and seaside scenery, and warmth of family-run establishments.

## The Interactive Experience

### Grilling Process
Place oysters flat-side up on grill and wait 5-10 minutes. You'll hear sizzling, and properly cooked oysters will "pop" open from heat. Use provided knives to pry open fully and detach oyster from shell. Hot seawater may squirt when oysters pop—wear provided jackets for protection.

### Atmosphere
Lively, informal atmosphere with families and groups gathered around grills. Communal tables create social dining experience. Hands-on involvement is expected—self-service grilling rather than passive restaurant service. Charcoal smoke will permeate clothes (plan accordingly).

- **Shellfish:** Turban shells (sazae), squid, scallops, tiger prawns, fresh fish
- **Kafuri Specialty:** Wild clams from Kafuri Bay (November-March only)
