Mount Rai (雷山, Rai-zan) is a 954.5-meter sacred mountain located on the border between Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture and Saga, Saga Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. As part of the Sefuri Mountain range, this holy mountain has been dedicated to Raijin, the Shinto god of thunder and lightning, for centuries. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rai)

The mountain holds deep cultural and religious significance, with Raizansennyoji Daihioin Temple (founded in 178 AD) positioned at 340 meters above sea level on the northern face. The entire mountain is believed to be sacred to Raijin, with Ikazuchi-jinja shrine located at the summit. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rai)

The mountain features multiple hiking routes ranging from challenging day hikes to extended traverses connecting to nearby Mount Iwara. The most popular route begins at Raizansennyoji Temple, ascending through heavily forested terrain characterized by moss-covered paths, multiple waterfalls (including Fudō Falls), and atmospheric conditions compared to Studio Ghibli films.
