Sakurai Shrine (æ«»äº•ç¥žç¤¾) stands as a remarkable spiritual guardian of the Itoshima Peninsula, established in 1632 by Kuroda Tadayuki, the second lord of the Fukuoka Domain. The shrine emerged from a legendary event in 1610 when a great thunderstorm struck and lightning opened an ancient burial mound, revealing a deity that gave rise to miraculous power. This sacred site represents a unique fusion of ancient burial practices and Shinto spirituality, built directly over the ancient tomb (Iwato-gu) with its covered structure serving as a symbol of the shrine's deep historical roots.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The shrine complex showcases exceptional Edo period architecture with its main hall (honden), worship hall (haiden), and tower gate (romon) arranged in perfect alignment. Built in 1632, the main hall displays refined architectural details including elaborate bracket complexes and richly colored sculptures that demonstrate the sophisticated craftsmanship of the early Edo period. All three original buildings from the founding period remain intact - an extremely rare occurrence that earned the shrine Important Cultural Property designation in 2023.

As the spiritual custodian of the Meoto Iwa, Sakurai Shrine plays a central role in preserving the shimenawa rope-making tradition. The shrine is dedicated to Izanagi and Izanami, the creator deities whose divine union is symbolized by the massive 30-meter, 1-ton shimenawa connecting the sacred offshore rocks. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japanbyweb.com/itoshimas-sakurai-futamigaura-married-rocks-and-white-torii/) Each late April to early May (April 27, 2025), the shrine oversees the ceremonial replacement of this sacred rope, a tradition requiring 50-80 community members in traditional happi coats to craft the rope using ancient wara-zaiku (straw craft) techniques (8:00-12:00), then carry and install it during spring tide low water (13:00-15:30). [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/event/sakurai-futamigaura-shimenawa-festival-2025/) This living tradition preserves the endangered art of sacred rope-making, where rice straw is twisted clockwise and entwined counterclockwise to create self-tensioning structure that maintains integrity. [ðŸ”—](https://www.entoten.com/2023/12/11/making-shimekazari-rope-decorations-with-rice-straw-from-koda-farms-in-california/) Throughout the shrine grounds, traditional shimenawa displays mark sacred spaces, demonstrating the rope's role in Shinto cosmology as boundaries between the divine and mundane worlds.

Adjacent to Sakurai Shrine stands Sakurai Daijingu, which enshrines the divided spirits of both the Inner and Outer Shrines of Ise Jingu. The connection to Ise Jingu is reinforced by the shrine's founding purpose in 1625 to enshrine the spirit of Ise Jingu, and the torii gate that was transferred from Ise Jingu's Outer Shrine during the 62nd regular rebuilding in 2013.
