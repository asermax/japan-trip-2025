Sakurai Shrine (æ«»äº•ç¥žç¤¾) stands as a remarkable spiritual guardian of the Itoshima Peninsula, established in 1632 by Kuroda Tadayuki, the second lord of the Fukuoka Domain. The shrine emerged from a legendary event in 1610 when a great thunderstorm struck and lightning opened an ancient burial mound, revealing a deity that gave rise to miraculous power. This sacred site represents a unique fusion of ancient burial practices and Shinto spirituality, built directly over the ancient tomb (Iwato-gu) with its covered structure serving as a symbol of the shrine's deep historical roots.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The shrine complex showcases exceptional Edo period architecture with its main hall (honden), worship hall (haiden), and tower gate (romon) arranged in perfect alignment. Built in 1632, the main hall displays refined architectural details including elaborate bracket complexes and richly colored sculptures that demonstrate the sophisticated craftsmanship of the early Edo period. All three original buildings from the founding period remain intact - an extremely rare occurrence that earned the shrine Important Cultural Property designation in 2023.

Adjacent to Sakurai Shrine stands Sakurai Daijingu, which enshrines the divided spirits of both the Inner and Outer Shrines of Ise Jingu. The connection to Ise Jingu is reinforced by the shrine's founding purpose in 1625 to enshrine the spirit of Ise Jingu, and the torii gate that was transferred from Ise Jingu's Outer Shrine during the 62nd regular rebuilding in 2013.

The massive tower gate creates an impressive entrance surrounded by ancient camphor and cedar trees that enhance the solemn atmosphere.

The unique Iwato-gu structure built over the ancient tomb provides a tangible connection to the site's pre-shrine spiritual significance. Visitors can appreciate the perfect architectural alignment of the main hall, worship hall, and tower gate, demonstrating the careful planning that went into the shrine's construction. The spiritual centerpiece extends to the nearby Sakurai Futamigaura, where the famous Meoto Iwa (Married Couple Rocks) serve as the shrine's Ura-no-miya (back shrine).

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Best Photography Spots:** Tower gate entrance with surrounding ancient trees, main hall showcasing colorful sculptures and architectural details, Iwato-gu structure over the ancient tomb, and the approach path through the wooded grounds. **Cultural Etiquette:** Bow before entering through the torii gate, purify hands and mouth at the temizuya (purification fountain), avoid photographing people in prayer, maintain quiet respectful behavior throughout the grounds, and dress modestly when visiting the sacred buildings. **Optimal Timing:** Visit on weekdays during November 1-2 stay, early morning or late afternoon provide the most serene experience, avoid weekends when the site becomes "super crowded."
