Hakoshima Jinja (箱島神社), whose name translates to "Box Island Shrine," is a small but culturally significant Shinto shrine perched on a tiny rocky island jutting into the sea along Itoshima's scenic Nijo Hamakubo coastline. The shrine's most distinctive feature is its location—surrounded by sea on three sides, creating a mystical appearance that evokes the legendary Ryugu (Dragon Palace) from Japanese mythology.

During the Edo period (1603-1868), this scenic spot was celebrated as a representation of the mythical Dragon Palace Castle and featured fancy restaurants from 1916 to 1943, serving as a popular destination for those seeking the romantic atmosphere of a waterborne paradise. [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/) Historical postcards from this era depict the location as "Suigo Hakoshima - Chidori no Yusho" (Water Village Hakoshima - Plovers at Evening), emphasizing its poetic natural beauty.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The shrine enshrines three important deities, each with distinct significance:
1. **Sayarimasu-Mihashira-no-Okami** (塞坐三柱大神) - The village guardian deity protecting the local region
2. **Nishinomiya Daimyojin** (西宮大明神) - Known as Ebisu, the god of business prosperity
3. **Aizen Myoo** (愛染明王) - The god of love, believed to help with romance, marriage, harmony, and beauty [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/)

The presence of Aizen Myoo, a Buddhist deity enshrined at a Shinto shrine, reflects Japan's historical syncretism between Buddhism and Shinto (shinbutsu-shugo). Aizen Myoo, whose name means "Wisdom King of Passionate Love," represents the Buddhist concept of transforming earthly desires and passionate love into spiritual wisdom and enlightenment. This unique combination of deities makes Hakoshima Shrine a distinctive spiritual site.

In recent years, the shrine experienced a renaissance in popularity. Starting in 2019, it began offering goshuin (temple stamps), which sparked renewed interest among both Japanese and international visitors. The shrine has become particularly popular as a "spiritual place" and "power spot" for love and relationships, with many women visiting to seek blessings for romance and marriage. Foreign tourists have compared the island's mysterious atmosphere to something from a Studio Ghibli film. [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/) [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/11811)

The shrine also holds an unusual distinction as the "god of ears" (耳の神様), with a unique ritual involving dedicated fire-breathing bamboo tubes. According to tradition, visitors can blow into their ears using these special bamboo implements, believed to cure ear diseases and ailments. [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/11811)

Hakoshima Shrine remains an uninhabited island with no permanent shrine office or staff, managed by the nearby Chinkaiseki Hachimangu Shrine and maintained by local residents. This unmanned status adds to its mystical, untouched quality. [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/)

## The Experience

**Island Exploration:**
Approach the shrine via the entrance marked by a "Hakoshima" signboard along National Route 202. Descend the unpaved path to reach the first torii gate at the shoreline. Cross the concrete walkway connecting the mainland to the island—this modern addition replaced an older bridge structure. [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/)

Once on the island, navigate natural rock steps carved into the terrain. These weathered stone pathways wind upward through the small island's rugged landscape. The main shrine structure (honden) sits atop the rocky outcrop, featuring traditional vermillion-colored architecture characteristic of Shinto shrines. [🔗](https://www.chinkaiseki.com/island/)

**Ritual Participation:**
Look for the unique fire-breathing bamboo tubes (fire-blowing bamboo) dedicated at the shrine. According to local tradition, visitors can use these bamboo implements to blow air into their ears as a ritual believed to cure ear diseases and ailments related to hearing. This unusual practice reflects the shrine's role as the "god of ears." [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/11811)
