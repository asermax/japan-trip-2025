Fukae Beach is a 700-meter-wide sandy beach in Nijō Fukae area of Itoshima, characterized by exceptionally shallow, calm waters. What truly distinguishes this beach is its remarkable natural phenomenon: at low tide, the receding water leaves a thin, mirror-like film on the sand that perfectly reflects the sky, clouds, and surrounding landscape. This stunning effect has earned Fukae Beach the nickname "Itoshima's Uyuni Salt Lake," referencing Bolivia's famous Salar de Uyuni salt flats.

The beach features clean water and white sand with naturally occurring pyrite that sparkles golden as you walk along the gently curved shoreline. From a local perspective, Fukae Beach is cherished for its calm, family-friendly atmosphere and serves as a gathering place for the community, particularly during traditional Sightseeing Beach Seine Fishing events held May to October.

Fukae is recognized as Itoshima's most readily accessible beach, located just 10-12 minutes walk from JR Chikuzen-Fukae Station, making it exceptionally convenient for visitors staying in the area. [🔗](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/fukuoka-beach-guide/)

## Cultural & Coastal Significance

The beach's mirror phenomenon connects to the cultural appreciation of natural beauty in Japanese aesthetics, where reflections and ephemeral moments hold special meaning. The comparison to Bolivia's Uyuni Salt Flats has made Fukae Beach increasingly popular with photographers seeking to capture the illusion of walking through clouds.

The traditional beach seine fishing (観光地引網) events represent an important aspect of local fishing culture, where visitors participate alongside community members in hauling large fishing nets and enjoying the fresh catch grilled on-site. This practice maintains connections to Itoshima's maritime heritage while welcoming visitors into local traditions. [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/spot/12459)

## The "Uyuni Salt Lake" Mirror Effect

The beach's most distinctive feature is the mirror-like reflections occurring at low tide. The receding water leaves a thin film on sand that creates perfect reflection of the sky, making it appear as if you're standing in the clouds. This phenomenon is particularly striking during sunrise and sunset when reflections are enhanced by dramatic lighting. [🔗](https://kagaminoumi.com/en/photo/)
