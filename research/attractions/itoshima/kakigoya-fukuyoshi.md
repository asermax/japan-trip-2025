Kakigoya (oyster huts) represent a cherished winter tradition in Fukuoka Prefecture, where seasonal dining establishments pop up at fishing ports from late October through March. At Fukuyoshi Fishing Port, four family-operated huts offer visitors the unique opportunity to grill fresh oysters and seafood directly over charcoal or gas grills in a communal, greenhouse-like setting.

The tradition began around 1990 when local fishermen started farming oysters in the nutrient-rich waters of the Genkai Sea and established these seasonal huts to sell their harvest directly to consumers. The Itoshima Peninsula's unique geography—close to mountains with nutrient-rich river water flowing into the sea—creates ideal conditions for oyster farming. Itoshima oysters, branded for their plump texture and milky sweetness, are among Japan's most famous oysters.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

The kakigoya tradition emerged in the early 1990s as a direct-to-consumer model for local oyster farmers. What began as a practical solution for fishermen to sell their harvest has evolved into one of Kyushu's most distinctive seasonal dining experiences and a cornerstone of Fukuoka's winter culinary scene. The Genkai Sea, recognized as one of Japan's richest fishing grounds, has supported the region's fishing industry for centuries. [🔗](https://itoshima-now.com/en/uotabi03/)

Kakigoya serve as more than dining establishments—they are cultural gathering places that bridge the local fishing community with visitors. The tradition embodies seasonal awareness, direct community connection through family operation by active fishermen, communal dining fostering social atmosphere, and hands-on experience creating engagement. Every year from November through March, these huts become bustling centers of activity. [🔗](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/articles/fuk_kaki)
