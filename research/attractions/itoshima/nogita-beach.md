Nogita Beach (野北海水浴場/野北海岸) is a celebrated natural beach on the eastern side of the 6km-long Nigi-no-Hama coastline. The beach has earned recognition as one of Japan's "Top 100 White Sand & Green Pines" beaches and is particularly famous for its spectacular sunsets, ranking among the top 100 in Japan.

The beach features soft, golden sand gently sloping into the emerald-green waters of the Genkai Sea. Its natural, unspoiled character maintains a rustic, tranquil atmosphere with minimal artificial structures. Shallow waters near shore make it safe for families, while reliable waves have established Nogita as one of Itoshima's premier surfing destinations. The iconic London Bus Cafe—a bright red double-decker bus converted into a cafe—has become one of Itoshima's most photographed landmarks.
