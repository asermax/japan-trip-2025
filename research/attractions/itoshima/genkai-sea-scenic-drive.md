The Genkai Sea scenic drive encompasses the coastal perimeter of the Itoshima Peninsula, offering one of Kyushu's most spectacular seaside driving experiences. The route follows Prefectural Road 54, commonly known as "Shima Sunset Road," which stretches 33.3 kilometers from Benten Bridge at the mouth of the Izumikawa River to Sakurai Futamigaura.

This coastal route is part of Japan's prestigious Scenic Byways program, with the Genkai Sea Byway extending approximately 178 kilometers through Fukuoka, Itoshima, and Karatsu. The Itoshima section showcases the region's designation as part of Genkai Quasi-National Park, established June 1, 1956. The drive features winding roads that curve in and out of bays, creating constantly changing perspectives of the coastline. Well-maintained smooth roads, open flats, and scenery make the peninsula attractive for both drivers and cyclists.

## Cultural & Geographic Significance

The Genkai Sea holds deep cultural importance in Japanese history and spirituality. The name "Genkai" comes from its position as the frontier between Japan and the Asian mainlandâ€”historically this was the gateway through which continental culture, Buddhism, and diplomatic missions arrived in Japan. The coastal route passes numerous ancient Shinto shrines that reflect this spiritual heritage, including sites where deities of safe sea passage and maritime prosperity are venerated.

The Itoshima Peninsula extends into the Genkai Sea at the northwestern edge of Fukuoka Prefecture, featuring a dramatic meeting of mountain and sea, with the Sefuri Mountains rising to the south while pristine beaches and rocky coastlines define the northern shores.

## Important Notes

### Critical Considerations for November 1-2

**Keya no Oto Boat Tour:** November is final operational month (April-November). Weather can cancel tours even on clear days. Visit early (November 1 morning) to allow backup day if canceled. Call ahead same day to verify operation. [ðŸ”—](https://itoshima-now.com/en/places/keya-no-oto/)

**Sunset Timing:** With sunset around 5:15-5:30 PM, daylight is limited. Plan route to arrive at western viewpoints by 4:30 PM for golden hour. Earlier days mean less time for full peninsula explorationâ€”prioritize key stops. [ðŸ”—](https://www.generalblue.com/sunrise-sunset-in-itoshima-fukuoka-japan)

**Parking Closures:** Futamigaura parking lot locks at night. Exit before darkness to avoid being locked in. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1769308-d1423877-Reviews-Sakurai_Futamigaura-Itoshima_Fukuoka_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)
