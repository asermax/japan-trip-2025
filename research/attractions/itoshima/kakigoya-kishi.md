Kishi Fishing Port (岐志漁港) hosts the largest concentration of oyster huts (kakigoya) in Itoshima with 11 distinct establishments. The port faces Hikitsu Bay on the Genkai Sea, one of the world's richest fishing grounds, and has such ancient significance that it was mentioned in the Man'yōshū, Japan's oldest poetry anthology.

All 11 oyster huts were completely renovated in 2019, transforming from vinyl house-style structures into permanent store-type facilities, each accommodating approximately 100 people. The huts are arranged in a row on shared grounds, creating a vibrant seasonal dining village. [🔗](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Kakigoya Tradition

The kakigoya tradition emerged from oyster farmers seeking to sell their harvest directly to the public. What began as simple direct-sale points evolved when fishermen started offering charcoal grills for customers to cook their purchases, creating the hamayaki (beach grilling) experience. This rustic, hands-on dining proved immensely popular, transforming simple shacks into bustling seasonal culinary destinations. [🔗](Gemini cultural research)

The kakigoya embody the principle of **chisan-chisho** (地産地消) - "local production for local consumption" - fostering regional economic self-sufficiency and pride. They represent the **satoumi** (里海) concept: the symbiotic relationship between coastal communities and the sea, where human activity and the marine environment are mutually beneficial. [🔗](Gemini cultural research)

Most importantly, kakigoya exemplify **shun** (旬), the Japanese principle of celebrating ingredients at the peak of their season. Operating only during winter months when oysters are at their absolute best, kakigoya perfectly embody this fundamental aspect of Japanese food culture. [🔗](Gemini cultural research)

### Oyster Farming in the Genkai Sea

The Genkai Sea's position near mountains means nutrient-rich river water flows from forests into the sea, creating ideal conditions for oyster farming. Scallop shells covered with oyster larvae are hung on floating racks for six months to a year. When ready, oysters are landed, polished, and sterilized with ultraviolet light and ozone before being shipped to the huts. This "sea-to-table" model ensures unparalleled freshness - oysters are often harvested from the bay just meters from where they're cooked. [🔗](https://itoshima-now.com/en/uotabi03/)
