Ito Sai Sai (伊都菜彩) stands as Japan's top-selling JA-operated direct market among more than 1,400 stores nationwide, with the highest number of register transactions in the entire JA Group. Operating since April 2007, the market serves approximately 1,200 registered farmers and producers who bring fresh products daily. An impressive 97% of agricultural and livestock products are Itoshima-produced. [🔗](https://ja-itoshima.or.jp/itosaisai/)

The spacious open-timbered store offers fresh seasonal vegetables and fruits at prices significantly below supermarkets, premium Itoshima beef and pork, freshly caught seafood from Itoshima's seven fishing ports, vibrant flowers, artisanal processed foods, and ready-to-eat items.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Chisan-Chisho Movement

Ito Sai Sai embodies Japan's "chisan-chisho" (地産地消) philosophy—"local production for local consumption"—a cultural and economic movement that gained momentum around 2000 in response to food safety concerns, rural economic challenges, and environmental consciousness. [🔗](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-007-9077-x)

The direct producer-to-consumer model allows local farmers to stock their own products on shelves and set their own prices, creating a transparent and dynamic marketplace. This system serves as an optimal entry point for new farmers to start selling, where they can gauge customer reactions while selecting crops to cultivate. Producers sometimes return to their fields to replenish produce when it runs low, ensuring exceptional freshness. [🔗](https://life.ja-group.jp/farm/market/detail?id=1209)

To minimize waste and strengthen community bonds, unsold products are donated to local food banks and children's cafeterias, demonstrating the market's role beyond commerce as a community hub. [🔗](https://special.nikkeibp.co.jp/NBO/businessfarm/innovation/69/)
