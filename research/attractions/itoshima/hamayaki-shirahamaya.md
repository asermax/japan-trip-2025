Hamayaki Shirahamaya (浜焼き白浜家) is a modern seafood barbecue restaurant opened in 2018 at Keya Fishing Port, distinguished by its stylish café-like design and year-round operation. The restaurant stands as a unique option in Itoshima's coastal dining scene - while the peninsula is famous for its seasonal kakigoya (oyster huts) that operate only from October to March, Shirahamaya maintains operations throughout the entire year.

Located directly at Keya Fishing Port with excellent oceanfront position, Shirahamaya offers both indoor table seating and an open-air terrace with stunning sea views. The location is part of the Genkai Quasi-National Park area and features in Japan's "100 Sunset Selection," making sunset dining a particularly special experience.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Hamayaki Tradition

Hamayaki (浜焼き), literally "beach grill," is a traditional Japanese culinary custom deeply rooted in fishing port culture. Originating with fishermen who would grill their fresh catch for quick, hearty meals, this simple practice has evolved into a significant cultural tradition embedded in the identity of Japan's coastal communities. The tradition represents a direct and unpretentious connection between the community and the sea, celebrating the day's catch and the hard work of local fishermen.

In Itoshima, hamayaki and kakigoya culture has become vital to the local economy and cultural identity. The peninsula's 26 seasonal oyster huts across five fishing ports attract tourists from across Japan during winter. Itoshima oysters have achieved registered trademark status, signifying their importance to regional identity. [🔗](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

### Keya Fishing Port Context

Keya Fishing Port sits in Hikitsu Bay, part of the Genkai Sea - considered "one of the world's richest fishing grounds." The area has deep historical roots with references in the Man'yōshū (Japan's oldest poetry anthology). Itoshima has consistently maintained the largest catch of wild sea bream in Japan for eight consecutive years, and local fishermen use sustainable methods including fixed net farming, shrimp trawling, pole-and-line fishing, and hand-digging for clams.

This hands-on approach connects diners directly to their food and the fishing port culture. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/13306/)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Grilling Etiquette & Technique

**How to Grill Oysters Properly:**
1. Use provided thick cotton gloves and long metal tongs
2. Wear protective jacket/apron to prevent stains
3. Place oysters cupped side down to cook in their own juices
4. First grill: Cook 3-4 minutes until juices bubble
5. Flip to flat side down, grill another 3-4 minutes
6. Oyster is ready when it pops open slightly
7. Use provided knife to pry shell fully open
8. Safety: Occasionally oysters "explode" if steam builds up

**Mochikomi (Bring-Your-Own) System:**
- Can bring: Drinks, special condiments (butter, lemon, garlic, cheese)
- Cannot bring: Other seafood or competing food items
- Etiquette: Purchase at least one drink from restaurant if bringing your own

### Best Photo Spots

- Sunset Terrace: Capture fresh seafood with ocean sunset
- Grilling Action: Close-ups of oysters sizzling with ocean backdrop
- Fishing Port Context: Wide shots including working fishing port
- Food Presentation: Live fish tanks, fresh seafood displays
- Keya no Oto Views: Basalt formations may be visible

### Crowd Avoidance

- Arrive at opening (11:00 AM) or mid-afternoon (3-4 PM)
- Weekday visits offer lighter crowds than weekends
- Book in advance to guarantee seating
- Early season November visits avoid peak December-January frenzy

### Money-Saving Options

- Lunch pricing (¥2,000) offers better value than dinner (¥4,000)
- Assess appetite: à la carte may be more economical; all-you-can-eat suits hearty appetites
- BYO drinks saves considerably if mochikomi system applies
- Shuttle service: Free for groups saves individual taxi costs

### Local Etiquette

- DIY grilling is central; embrace hands-on participation
- This is leisurely meal; take time, enjoy process and views
- Use "Sumimasen" (excuse me) to get staff attention
- Say "Gochisousama deshita" (thank you for the meal) when leaving
- Use provided bucket for empty shells
- Wear casual clothes (smoke lingers)

## November Visit Highlights

**Oyster Season Timing:** November represents early weeks of Itoshima's celebrated oyster season, meaning oysters will be in prime condition with full flavor development. [🔗](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/itoshima-kakigoya-oyster-hut-guide/)

**Weather:** Mild autumn temperatures (15-18°C / 59-64°F), pleasant for outdoor terrace dining

**Sunset:** Occurs around 5:15-5:30 PM in early November - perfect timing for sunset dining experience

**Crowd Levels:** Early season timing means fewer crowds than peak December-January period

**Photography:** Excellent natural lighting in late afternoon (4-5 PM); sunset golden hour around 5:00-5:30 PM

### Year-Round Operation Advantage

**Critical Distinction:** Hamayaki Shirahamaya operates year-round (until 9-10 PM daily), unique among Itoshima's seafood BBQ options. Traditional kakigoya operate only October/November through March and often close earlier (around 5-6 PM). This provides flexibility for visit planning.
