Magome-juku was the forty-third of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasend≈ç connecting Edo with Kyoto in Edo period Japan. It is located in former Mino Province in what is now part of the city of Nakatsugawa, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, and was also the last of eleven stations along the Kisoji, which was the precursor to a part of the Nakasend≈ç running through the Kiso Valley.

**Route Significance:** Magome-juku represents a distinctive stop on the Fujikawaguchiko-Takayama scenic route, offering a unique hillside post town experience. The name "Magome" (È¶¨Á±†) originates from the words for "horse" (È¶¨) and "basket" (Á±†), as the steep terrain often forced travelers to leave their horses at the inns and proceed on foot. This challenging terrain sets it apart from flatter post towns, creating a dramatic cobblestone streetscape perfect for route travelers seeking cultural immersion.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Historical Background

The village is very old, appearing in Kamakura period records dated 1215 as part of the T≈çyama Sh≈çen, which had been awarded by Minamoto no Yoritomo to Kikuhime, the half-sister of Minamoto no Yoshinaka who lived in this location. In the early Edo period, the system of post stations on the Nakasend≈ç was formalized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1602, and it became a stopping place for traveling merchants and was also on the sankin-k≈çtai route used by various western daimy≈ç to-and-from the Shogun's court in Edo. [üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magome-juku)

During the Edo period (1603-1868), the Nakasendo was a vital inland route connecting the shogun's capital in Edo (now Tokyo) with the imperial capital in Kyoto. Magome-juku, situated in the mountainous Kiso Valley, served as a crucial stop for daimy≈ç (feudal lords), samurai, merchants, and pilgrims. The town provided lodging, food, and rest for travelers undertaking the arduous journey.

### Restoration and Modern Era

With the completion of the Ch≈´≈ç Main Line railway, Magome fell into obscurity and poverty; many of its old buildings were destroyed by fires in 1895 and 1915. However, dedicated efforts by local residents in the post-war era have led to the meticulous restoration of the town's historic streetscape. In recent decades, it has been restored to its appearance as an Edo period post town and is now a popular tourist destination. [üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magome-juku)

The town's main street, a 600-meter stone-paved path, is lined with reconstructed wooden inns, tea houses, and residences, all built in the traditional style. Unlike some other preserved towns, Magome is not a sterile museum; it is a living community where residents work to maintain the town's historical integrity.

### Literary Connection

Magome is the birthplace of the renowned Meiji-era author Shimazaki Toson (1872-1943). His most famous historical novel, *Before the Dawn* (Yoake Mae), is set in Magome and chronicles the life of his father, a village headman, during the turbulent transition from the Tokugawa shogunate to the Meiji Restoration. The novel provides a vivid portrayal of life in a remote mountain village during this period of profound change. The Toson Memorial Museum, located on the site of his childhood home, offers insights into his life and work.
