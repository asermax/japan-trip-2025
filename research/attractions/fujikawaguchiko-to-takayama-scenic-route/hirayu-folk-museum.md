Hirayu Folk Museum (Hirayu Minzokukan/平湯民俗館) is described as "a hidden sightseeing spot in the Hirayu-onsen area" featuring two historic gassho-zukuri farmhouses relocated to preserve Hida region's mountain cultural heritage. The museum complex consists of traditional straw-roofed farmhouses displaying tools and daily items from traditional rural life in the Japanese Alps. [🔗](https://www.okuhida.or.jp/en/archives/1779)

The museum's first floor displays a sunken fireplace room (irori) and hemp clothing showing old rural life, while the second floor exhibits farm tools introducing the history of the Hida region. [🔗](https://www.okuhida.or.jp/en/archives/1779)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**The Two Historic Buildings:**

1. **Old Takakuwa House (旧高桑家):** A gassho-zukuri structure relocated over 40 years ago from Toga Village in Toyama Prefecture. This building now serves as a rest area where visitors can relax on tatami mats around the traditional irori (sunken hearth). [🔗](https://hidasanmyaku-gifu.jp/investigate/spot/hirayu-folk-museum/)

2. **Old Toyosaka House (旧豊坂家):** Built during the mid-Edo period (18th century), this designated Takayama City cultural property was relocated from the Kurabashira district. The building features wooden construction with a thatched roof and hip-and-gable roof style. [🔗](https://hidasanmyaku-gifu.jp/investigate/spot/hirayu-folk-museum/)

**Enku Buddhist Statues:** The museum houses statues carved by Enku (1632-1695), a traveling Buddhist monk and poet born in Gifu Prefecture who vowed to carve 120,000 wooden statues. Enku's statues are distinctive for their simple yet powerful expressions, carved from tree stumps or scrap wood with a few strokes of a hatchet. These works are deeply connected to Hida's spiritual culture and were favored by villagers from the Edo period onward.

**Adjacent Hot Spring:** The museum adjoins Hirayu-no-yu, a public bath facility with characteristic reddish-brown hot spring water. The outdoor bath features spring water directly from the source and is located in a grove of trees, creating an atmospheric experience. [🔗](https://www.okuhida.or.jp/en/archives/1779)
