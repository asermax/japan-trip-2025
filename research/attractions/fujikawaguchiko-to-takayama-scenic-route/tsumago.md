Tsumago-juku is the 42nd of the 69 post towns along the historic Nakasendo highway, an Edo-period (1603-1867) trade route connecting Kyoto and Edo (modern Tokyo). It stands as Japan's best-preserved post town and was the pioneering location for historic preservation in Japan, designated as a Nationally Designated Architectural Preservation Site in 1976.

**Route Significance:** Located along Route 19 through the Kiso Valley, Tsumago represents the cultural heart of the Nakasendo portion of the Fujikawaguchiko-Takayama scenic route. The town's exceptional preservation makes it a must-see cultural immersion stop. Cars are prohibited on the main street during daylight hours, and power lines are concealed underground, creating an authentic Edo-period atmosphere unmatched in Japan.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Tsumago-juku served as a vital rest stop for travelers during the Edo period, providing lodging, food, and services to feudal lords (daimyo), samurai, merchants, and pilgrims traveling between Kyoto and Edo. The town was officially designated as a post town in 1601 by shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu as part of the post town system. [ðŸ”—](https://d-japantravel.com/travel/tsumago-juku)

The town played a crucial role in the sankin kotai system, which required feudal lords to travel from their domains to Edo every second year with large retinues, sometimes numbering up to 3,000 samurai and attendants. The honjin (principal inn) served as exclusive lodging for feudal lords and government officials, while the wakihonjin (secondary inn) accommodated other important travelers.

### Preservation Pioneer

Tsumago-juku represents a groundbreaking achievement in Japanese cultural preservation. In 1968, at a time when Japan's urban development was at full tilt, local residents initiated the first comprehensive preservation movement in Japan, establishing three core principles: no houses or land should be "sold, rented, or demolished." [ðŸ”—](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/japan-travel-planner/nagano/0000009.html)

This dedication led to designation as Japan's first Important Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings. To maintain historical authenticity, modern elements like electrical wires are buried underground, and the main street is closed to vehicular traffic during daylight hours. The town continues as a living community with approximately 200 residents, though tourist shops now form the main business. [ðŸ”—](https://japanupclose.web-japan.org/techculture/c20221125_4.html)

### Architectural Heritage

The 700-meter main street (Terashita Street) showcases authentic Edo-period architecture with beautifully maintained wooden townhouses (machiya). Key architectural treasures include:

**Honjin:** Reconstructed in the 1990s to resemble its 1830s condition when it served as the town's highest-ranked inn exclusively for feudal lords and the shogun. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6077.html)

**Wakihonjin-Okuya (Important Cultural Property, 2001):** The original main building dates to the 19th century and was renovated in 1877 using Japanese cypress after the lifting of logging bans. Features include a beautiful moss garden and a special toilet built for Emperor Meiji (who never visited). [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJtrv0657-en/)
