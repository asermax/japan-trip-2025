## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Hida no Takumi Legacy

The Hida region has been Japan's carpentry workshop for over 1,300 years, with a remarkable history dating to the 8th century. During the Nara period (710-794 CE), an imperial government directive exempted the Hida region from taxation in exchange for providing master woodworkers to the capital. Over 600 years, between 40,000 to 50,000 carpenters known as "Hida no Takumi" (Masters of Hida) were sent to build famous shrines and temples throughout Japan.

This legacy of exceptional craftsmanship extended beyond carpentry to specialized regional techniques that continue today.

### Traditional Craft Forms

**Ichii Ittou Carving** - Designated as a National Traditional Craft in 1975, this art form uses Japanese yew wood (ichii) aged 400-500 years, carved exclusively with chisels (ittou) to reveal the natural beauty of the wood grain without coloring. The technique was established by Sukenaga Matsuda during the later Edo period (1603-1868). [ðŸ”—](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/ichiiittobori/)

**Hida Shunkei Lacquerware** - Boasting over 400 years of history beginning in the 17th century, this elegant craft uses clear lacquer to highlight the natural wood grain, creating sophisticated tableware and ornaments in yellow or crimson hues that deepen and change over time. [ðŸ”—](https://kougeihin.jp/en/craft/0516/)

**Sarubobo Dolls** - Traditional amulets from the Hida region, these faceless red human-shaped dolls were historically made by grandmothers for grandchildren and daughters. The name literally means "baby monkey" in the local dialect. They symbolize three main wishes: protection from bad things, happiness in home and relationships, and easy childbirth.
