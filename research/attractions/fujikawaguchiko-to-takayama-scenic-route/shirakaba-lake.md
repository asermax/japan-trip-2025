Lake Shirakaba is an artificial reservoir at 1,416 meters elevation, originally constructed in the mid-1950s as "Tateshina Great Pond" to improve rice irrigation for the agricultural region below. [🔗](https://www.shirakabako.com/en/news/白樺湖について/) The lake transformed from a functional water source into Nagano's premier highland resort destination, earning its current name from the distinctive white birch bushes (shirakaba) that surround its shores.

Situated at the northernmost point of the Yatsugatake mountain range, the lake sits at the strategic intersection of Daimon Highway and Venus Line on National Route 152. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2000598/) The artificial lake spans approximately 36 hectares with a perimeter of 3.8-4 kilometers and reaches depths up to 9 meters. [🔗](https://www.getamap.net/maps/japan/japan_(general)/_shirakaba_lake/)

The resort area has evolved into the Venus Line's most comprehensive destination, featuring major resort complexes centered around the Ikenotaira Hotel, multiple ski resorts on surrounding hillsides, three forest museums, an amusement park, and complete recreational infrastructure. Mount Tateshina, nicknamed the "Fuji of Suwa" for its conical shape, provides a dramatic backdrop visible from the lakeside promenade and observation points. [🔗](https://www.go-nagano.net/en/trip-idea/the-venus-line-guide)

The lake's high altitude creates a microclimate nearly 1,000 meters cooler than the nearby city of Chino, making it a summer retreat and early autumn foliage destination. The surrounding white birch forests turn golden in October, followed by brilliant red and orange larch trees through November, with morning mirror-like reflections of the colorful mountains on the lake's calm surface.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Lake Shirakaba represents the transformation of Japanese infrastructure from purely utilitarian purposes to multi-use cultural destinations. The 1945 agricultural reservoir became a recreational centerpiece, demonstrating Japan's post-war evolution toward leisure tourism and mountain resort development.

The resort area embodies the Japanese concept of highland retreats (高原リゾート, kōgen rizōto), where urban populations escape summer heat to cooler mountain elevations. This tradition dates to the Meiji period when Western-style summer villas appeared in highland areas, but democratized in the post-war era with improved road access and middle-class prosperity. [🔗](https://www.shirakabako.com/en/news/白樺湖について/)

The Venus Line's transformation from toll road to free public highway in 2002 accelerated Lake Shirakaba's accessibility, making highland experiences available to broader audiences rather than elite tourists willing to pay premiums for mountain access.

## Seasonal Considerations for October 24, 2025

### Autumn Foliage Timing

Mid-to-late October represents peak color transition, with white birch trees turning golden yellow and early larch coloration beginning. [🔗](https://matcha-jp.com/en/22305) The foliage season progresses from white birch in October through larch trees into November, ensuring vibrant displays during the October 24 visit.

### Weather Conditions

[🔗](https://www.agatetravel.com/japan/weather-in-october.html) October typically features clear skies with minimal rainfall - ideal driving and photography conditions. The high altitude creates autumn atmosphere while lower elevations remain warm.

### Crowd Levels

October weekends see increased visitors for autumn foliage viewing, though significantly less congested than summer peak season.
