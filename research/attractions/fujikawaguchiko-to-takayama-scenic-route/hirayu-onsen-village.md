Hirayu Onsen is the oldest and largest hot spring village in the Okuhida Onsengo region of Gifu Prefecture, serving as a historic traveler rest stop and modern gateway to the Northern Japan Alps. Discovered in the 1560s by Takeda Shingen's troops according to legend, this mountain onsen village has evolved from a vital samurai rest stop into the primary transportation hub for accessing Kamikochi and other alpine destinations. The village offers free public foot baths (ashiyu), traditional ryokan accommodations, and serves as an ideal short rest stop for driving travelers exploring the route between Fujikawaguchiko and Takayama.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Historical Discovery and Legend

Hirayu Onsen's discovery is rooted in a legendary tale from the Sengoku (Warring States) period around the 1560s. According to legend chronicled in Edo-period texts like the *Hishu-shi* (Records of Hida), forces of the powerful warlord Takeda Shingen were crossing treacherous mountain passes when soldiers collapsed from exhaustion and poisonous volcanic gases from Mt. Yakedake. A wise old white ape appeared and led the ailing soldiers to a spring of hot water gushing from the ground, where they bathed and were miraculously restored to health. [🔗](https://www.snowmonkeyresorts.com/activities/hirayu-onsen/)

The name "Hirayu" (平湯) derives from the concept of "peaceful" or "healing" water. In honor of this legend, the local Hirayu Shrine now enshrines the white ape as a guardian spirit of the onsen. The village became Japan's first officially designated national hot spring resort in 1964. [🔗](https://japanandmore.com/hirayu-onsen-in-takayama/)

### Strategic Location and Evolution

For centuries, Hirayu's strategic location on mountain routes connecting Hida (modern-day Gifu) to Shinshu (Nagano) made it an essential post town (*shukuba*). During the Edo Period, feudal lords (daimyo) traveling to and from Edo (Tokyo) for their mandatory *sankin-kōtai* service used Hirayu as a place to rest and recover from arduous mountain journeys. The healing waters were invaluable for soothing tired muscles and treating injuries suffered during travel. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5942.html)

The onsen also served commoners, including merchants transporting goods and pilgrims on spiritual journeys, cementing Hirayu's identity not just as a hot spring but as a vital point of refuge and recovery deeply woven into the fabric of travel in feudal Japan.

Today, Hirayu Onsen maintains its historical role as a traveler's stop while serving as the primary transportation hub for Chūbu-Sangaku National Park. The Hirayu Bus Terminal is the main transfer point for all visitors heading to Kamikochi, as private cars are banned from the alpine valley to preserve its pristine environment.

### Therapeutic Waters

With over 40 different natural hot spring sources, Hirayu boasts an incredible volume of naturally hot mineral-rich water. The spring waters are said to be effective at treating intestinal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, neuralgia, sensitivity to cold, and skin diseases.
