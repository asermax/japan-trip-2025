Hirayu Pass (平湯峠, Hirayu Touge) is a historic mountain pass at 1,684 meters elevation in the Hida Mountains, offering panoramic views of the Northern Alps and Mount Hakusan. This pass represents a significant cultural landmark where the ancient Hirayu Kaido trade route once crossed the formidable Japanese Alps, connecting Gifu and Nagano prefectures. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/平湯峠)

At 1,684 meters elevation, this pass once marked the critical crossing point on the historic **Hirayu Kaido** (平湯街道), the vital trade and travel route connecting the Hida Province (modern Gifu Prefecture) with the Shinshu Province (modern Nagano Prefecture) during the Edo Period. The pass was classified as a *nansho* (難所)—a "difficult place"—notorious for steep inclines, sharp curves, and severe winter weather that made travel nearly impossible during snowy months. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/平湯峠)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Until 1923, the Hirayu Kaido across the pass was merely a rugged footpath traversed by merchants transporting salt, rice, and timber, as well as pilgrims seeking the healing waters of Hirayu Onsen. The first vehicle-suitable road was carved in 1923, but it remained narrow and perilous. The most significant transformation came in 1978 when the Hirayu Tunnel (2,430m long, elevation 1,445m) opened, bypassing the highest and most treacherous section of the pass and finally enabling safe year-round travel. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/平湯峠)

In Japanese tradition, mountain passes (*touge* 峠) hold deep symbolic significance beyond their geographical function. The character "峠" is a uniquely Japanese creation (*kokuji*), combining elements meaning "mountain," "up," and "down." Passes were viewed as spiritual boundaries between the known and unknown, often marked by shrines to **Dōsojin** deities who protect travelers and ward off evil spirits. This tradition connects to *Sangaku Shinkō* (山岳信仰), the ancient practice of mountain worship where peaks were revered as sources of life-giving water and passes served as sacred gateways to these formidable domains.

The pass's beauty and significance were immortalized by renowned poet **Wakayama Bokusui** (1885-1928), who crossed in October 1921 and composed a poem capturing the sublime autumn atmosphere. A stone monument (*kahi* 歌碑) bearing his verse stands near the summit, cementing the pass's reputation as a place of artistic inspiration. [🔗](https://www.hirayuonsen.or.jp/article.php?id=10181)

## The Experience

The pass offers commanding views of the Northern Alps (Hida Mountains) stretching to the northeast and Mount Hakusan visible to the west. The elevation of 1,684 meters provides an unobstructed alpine perspective over multiple mountain ranges. Standing at this historic crossing point, visitors can appreciate the same vistas that challenged and inspired travelers for centuries. [🔗](https://www.hirayuonsen.or.jp/article.php?id=10181)

Near the pass summit stands a stone monument (*kahi*) inscribed with a poem by celebrated poet Wakayama Bokusui, who crossed the pass in October 1921. The monument represents a touchpoint of Japanese literary culture, marking where natural beauty inspired artistic creation.

In mid-to-late October, the pass transforms into what visitors describe as a living painting. Rowan trees turn "vividly crimson," while maple and mountain ash add layers of red, orange, and gold. The curving mountain road with perpendicular rock walls on one side and deep valleys on the other creates dramatic photographic compositions.
