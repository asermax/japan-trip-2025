Kaida Kogen is a spectacular 1,100-1,300 meter high plateau extending along the base of Mount Ontake in Kiso-machi, Nagano Prefecture. This pristine highland is renowned as the birthplace and conservation center for Kiso horses (Kisouma), Japan's only native horse breed from Honshu, with a 1,400-year history. The plateau is also celebrated as one of Nagano Prefecture's premier buckwheat growing regions, earning it the reputation as "soba noodle paradise."

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The Kiso horse is a living symbol of the Kiso region's history and cultural identity. Originating from horses brought from the Asian mainland over 1,400 years ago, these sturdy animals were indispensable in the mountainous terrain of Nagano. Their strong build and hooves made them perfect companions for samurai warfare and agricultural work, transporting goods and people through steep mountain passes. Historically, Kiso horses were considered family members, often living under the same roof as their owners. [ðŸ”—](https://japanrailandtravel.com/interests/activities/cultural-nature-activities/kiso-uma-no-sato/)

The breed faced near extinction during the Meiji Period (1868-1912) when government policy promoted crossbreeding with larger Western horses for military purposes, nearly wiping out the pure bloodline. After World War II, the breed was saved by dedicated individuals who preserved the last remaining purebreds. Today, the population remains critically small at around 150 horses, protected as a Nagano Prefecture treasure. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiso_Horse)

The highland's elevation, significant day-to-night temperature swings, and morning fogs create ideal conditions for cultivating high-quality, aromatic buckwheat. The art of hand-making soba noodles (soba-uchi) is a deeply respected local tradition, with a saying that "a woman skilled in making soba will be a good wife."

Mount Ontake is one of Japan's most important sacred mountains and a center for mountain worship (Shugendo) for over a thousand years. Kaida Kogen serves as a natural "front porch" for the sacred peak, offering breathtaking, unobstructed views and serving as the starting point for the Kaidaguchi climbing trail.
