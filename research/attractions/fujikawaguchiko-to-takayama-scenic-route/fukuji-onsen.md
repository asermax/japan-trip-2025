Fukuji Onsen (福地温泉, also romanized as Fukuchi Onsen) is one of five intimate hot spring villages comprising the Okuhida Onsengo area in the Northern Japan Alps of Gifu Prefecture. Established approximately 40 years ago, it is relatively new yet has cultivated some of the most atmospheric, traditionally styled ryokan in Okuhida by constructing inns with reclaimed wood from old farmhouses.

This small village, approximately 3 km from end to end, sits at the foot of Mt. Fukuji at an elevation of 1,671 meters along the Takahara River. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02304-on00154/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The village's most distinguished identity stems from its connection to **Emperor Murakami** (reigned 946-967 AD). According to local legend actively celebrated through the "Henbetori" lion dance—a local performing art designated as intangible cultural heritage of Takayama City—the emperor made a secret visit during the Heian period (794-1185) to recuperate from illness. This imperial endorsement earned the hot spring the revered nickname "Tennō Izumi" (天皇泉), or "Emperor's Spring." [🔗](https://www.nippon.com/en/guide-to-japan/gu005006/)

The Henbetori dance reenacts the story of Emperor Murakami calming and defeating poisonous snakes that plagued villagers by playing a flute, solidifying the village's deep-rooted connection to its imperial legend.

The heart of Fukuji Onsen's traditional atmosphere is the **Mukashibanashi-no-Sato (昔話の里)**, a recreated traditional mountain village of old Japanese houses complete with sunken hearths and nostalgic Showa-era ambiance. This cultural complex includes the Isurugi-no-Yu public bath, Fukuji Fossil Museum, and the year-round morning market. [🔗](https://hidasanmyaku-gifu.jp/investigate/spot/mukashibanashi-en/)
