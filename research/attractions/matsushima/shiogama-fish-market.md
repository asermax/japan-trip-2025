Shiogama Seafood Wholesale Market (Shiogama Suisanbutsu Nakaoroshi Ichiba) is one of the last great old-school fish markets in Japan's Tohoku Region and a culinary landmark in what locals call the "Sushi Capital of Japan." [🔗](https://visitmiyagi.com/articles/shiogama-seafood-wholesale-market/) Located in the port city of Shiogama between Sendai and Matsushima, this working wholesale market opens its doors to the public, offering an authentic, non-touristy seafood experience centered around the famous "My Kaisendon" create-your-own seafood bowl tradition. [🔗](https://soranews24.com/2024/10/25/non-tourist-trap-fish-market-in-northeastern-japan-captures-our-hearts-with-amazing-sashimi/)

Established in its current location in 1965, the market has become one of Japan's most important fishing ports and busiest fish processing centers, with the port unloading more fresh tuna than any other location in the country.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Shiogama earned the distinction of having the highest number of sushi restaurants per capita in the entire country, solidifying its reputation as Japan's "Sushi Capital." [🔗](https://thehiddenjapan.com/shiogama-the-sushi-capital-of-japan/) The coastal waters off Shiogama are among the richest fishing grounds in Japan, and the market features at least twenty stalls specializing exclusively in maguro (red tuna). [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-sendai_matsushima/article-a3000068/)

Shiogama derives its name ("salt furnace") from an ancient method of harvesting salt by boiling seawater in large kettles, reflecting the city's long maritime heritage. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiogama) The area has been settled since at least the Jomon period, and during the Nara period came under control of colonists from the imperial dynasty, becoming the most important seaport in Mutsu. [🔗](https://www.miyagi-ajet.org/shiogama-area-guide.html) The market was rebuilt after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. [🔗](https://www.miyagi-ajet.org/shiogama-area-guide.html)

The market contains approximately 140 shops and stalls selling fresh and processed seafood products, with 89 specialty stalls offering several hundred varieties of seafood including fresh and frozen fish, tuna, octopus, prawns, oysters, dried fish, and processed marine products.

## The "My Kaisendon" Experience

The market's signature attraction is the interactive kaisendon (seafood rice bowl) experience, where visitors become chefs of their own meal. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-sendai_matsushima/article-a3000068/)

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Browse the Market** – Walk through approximately 100 seafood stalls, particularly the 20+ tuna specialists, to view the incredible variety of fresh catches. Vendors display small packs of sashimi-grade seafood including tuna, shrimp, octopus, squid, salmon roe (ikura), sea urchin (uni), and horse mackerel. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12582/)

2. **Select Your Toppings** – Purchase individual sashimi pieces or pre-assembled sets from different vendors. Fresh seafood is sold in small packs priced from ¥300 to ¥500. Shop staff will slice fish according to your request, customizing portions specifically for kaisendon. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5043.html) [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12582/)

3. **Buy Your Rice Base** – Head to the "My Kaisendon" corner at Sales Area 6 (south exit) to purchase a rice set for ¥400, which includes miso soup. Three rice sizes available: regular, large, and extra large. For an additional ¥50, request vinegar sushi rice. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-sendai_matsushima/article-a3000068/) [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5043.html)

4. **Assemble and Enjoy** – Arrange your purchased seafood on the rice at the neighboring eat-in area, creating your personalized kaisendon masterpiece. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-sendai_matsushima/article-a3000068/)

- **Wholesale Shopping** – The market allows the general public to buy products at wholesale prices [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12582/)

## November Seasonal Specialties

**Premium Autumn Tuna Season:** November falls within the October-December window for Sanriku Shiogama Higashimono, the market's branded bigeye tuna noted for supreme freshness, fattiness, color and gloss. Only 5 to 10 fish out of 100 are certified as Higashimono, making it difficult to find outside Miyagi Prefecture and a true November specialty. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-miyagi-suburbs/article-a3000017/)

**Weather:** November in Miyagi brings cooler temperatures (average 8-14°C). The market is primarily indoors, though the BBQ terrace is outdoors. [🔗](https://visitmiyagi.com/articles/shiogama-seafood-wholesale-market/)

**Crowd Levels:** November is outside peak tourist season, offering a more authentic local experience. Weekends remain busier than weekdays, with the market most animated between 8:00-11:00 AM. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5043.html)
