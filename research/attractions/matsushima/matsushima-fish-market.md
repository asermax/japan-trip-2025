Matsushima Fish Market (松島さかな市場) is a tourist-oriented seafood market operated by a Kesennuma-based fishing company that owns seven large tuna vessels. [🔗](https://www.sakana-ichiba.co.jp/en/) The market serves as a direct retail and dining destination showcasing the extraordinary bounty of Matsushima Bay and the broader Tohoku coastal region, featuring "more than 1,500 kinds of raw fish and frozen fish from all over Japan" alongside dried fish, canned products, and traditional fish cakes. [🔗](https://www.sakana-ichiba.co.jp/en/)

The market building spans two floors, with the ground floor operating as retail space and the second floor housing a dining area where visitors can enjoy seasonal seafood prepared as sushi, donburi rice bowls, barbecue, and ramen. [🔗](https://www.sakana-ichiba.co.jp/en/)

## Cultural & Environmental Significance

The market's exceptional seafood quality stems from Matsushima Bay's unique geographic advantages. The area's intricate ria coastline creates gentle, sheltered waters where nutrient-rich freshwater from surrounding mountains meets the sea. Offshore, the collision of two major ocean currents—the cold Oyashio Current and warm Kuroshio Current—generates an abundance of plankton that nourishes the bay's marine life, creating what locals call "the nursery of the sea."

Matsushima sits at the heart of Miyagi Prefecture—Japan's second-largest oyster producer accounting for over 50% of the nation's seed oyster supply. Oyster cultivation in the area dates to the 17th century, and by 1926, a complete system of oyster farming had been perfected following traditional methods that persist today with minimal environmental impact.
