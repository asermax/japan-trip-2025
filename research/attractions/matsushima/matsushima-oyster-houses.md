*Matsushima Tourism Association Oyster Shack - one of several kakigoya offering all-you-can-eat grilled oysters*

Matsushima Bay has been cultivating oysters for over 300 years, and today Miyagi Prefecture boasts the second highest oyster production in Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/22326) The bay's exceptional oyster quality stems from its position where the cold Oyashio and warm Kuroshio currents converge, creating a nutrient-rich, plankton-abundant environment that produces luxuriously succulent oysters with a rich, faintly sweet taste. [ðŸ”—](https://jnto.tohokumoment.com/en/miyagi/t8-matsushima_kakir_goya/)

Between late October and mid-March, several kakigoya (oyster shacks) operate along the waterfront, offering the quintessential Matsushima oyster experience: all-you-can-eat grilled oysters in casual, steamy pier-side settings. [ðŸ”—](https://discoversendai.travel/places/matsushima-tourism-association-oyster-shack/) Diners pay upfront and are seated at communal grilling tables where they don gloves, shuck their own oysters, and pluck the sweet, delicate meat from the shells with chopsticks as staff continuously pile the grills high with fresh oysters.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

The region's oyster aquaculture tradition dates to the 1600s when a large number of oysters was discovered along the cove of Nonojima Island in Matsushima Bay. After centuries of wild harvesting depleted natural stocks, a complete system of oyster aquaculture was developed by 1926, resulting in increased quality and production. [ðŸ”—](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tohoku/in-pref-miyagi/in-sendai_matsushima/article-a3000047/)

The convergence of the Oyashio (cold, nutrient-rich) and Kuroshio (warm) currents offshore creates an abundance of plankton, providing optimal nutrition for oysters. Combined with nutrients from surrounding mountains flowing into the bay, Matsushima oysters develop a luxuriously succulent texture with a rich, faintly sweet flavor. [ðŸ”—](https://jnto.tohokumoment.com/en/miyagi/t8-matsushima_kakir_goya/)

From October to March, oysters reach their peak as "chubby oysters," having fattened up during the colder months when they store nutrients and develop maximum flavor. November marks the beginning of the season when oysters are at their "chubbiest." [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/22326)
