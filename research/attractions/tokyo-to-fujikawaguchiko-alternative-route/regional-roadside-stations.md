## Basic Information

The Gotemba to Fujikawaguchiko route via Route 138 offers three strategic roadside stations (Michi-no-Eki) that combine essential rest facilities with regional specialties and spectacular Mount Fuji views. These government-designated rest areas serve as cultural gateways to the Mount Fuji region.

## Cultural Significance of Michi-no-Eki

Michi-no-Eki roadside stations represent a uniquely Japanese approach to road travel, established in 1993 to serve both travelers and local communities. These facilities embody *chisan-chisho* (producing and consuming local food), supporting rural communities through direct-to-consumer agricultural markets. [üîó](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/michi-no-eki/)

Unlike typical highway rest stops, Michi-no-Eki function as regional cultural centers, hosting farmers' markets, local events, and traditional performances. With over 1,193 stations across all 47 prefectures, they provide authentic encounters with local culture.
