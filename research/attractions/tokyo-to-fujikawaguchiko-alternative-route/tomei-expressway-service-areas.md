The Tomei Expressway (Êù±ÂêçÈ´òÈÄüÈÅìË∑Ø) is a national expressway on Honshu connecting Tokyo and Nagoya, operated by Central Nippon Expressway Company (NEXCO Central). For travelers heading from Tokyo to Fujikawaguchiko via the alternative southern route, the Tomei Expressway provides a distinctly different character from the more direct Chuo Expressway, with service areas showcasing Kanagawa and eastern Shizuoka cultures rather than Yamanashi's mountainous character. [üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dmei_Expressway)

The Tomei route is one of Japan's most heavily traveled expressways, with some sections handling over 100,000 vehicles daily. Service areas are strategically placed approximately every 50 km, while smaller parking areas appear roughly every 15-20 km, ensuring comfortable breaks for long-distance travelers. [üîó](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2354.html)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Japanese service areas reflect the cultural value of "omotenashi" (selfless hospitality). Restroom cleanliness, facility maintenance, and attention to visitor needs exemplify this principle. International travelers consistently note the exceptional quality of Japanese highway facilities compared to global counterparts. [üîó](https://billkralovec.com/2015/12/31/quirky-japan-highway-rest-stops/)

Service areas serve as prime locations for purchasing "omiyage" (souvenirs) - an important aspect of Japanese gift-giving culture. Travelers traditionally bring local specialties back for family, friends, and colleagues. [üîó](https://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00002/)

Several major service areas carry the "EXPASA" designation, a brand NEXCO Central introduced during large-scale renovations beginning in fiscal 2010. EXPASA represents a transformational concept shifting service areas from "transit facilities" to "stay destinations" - commercial complexes where travelers are encouraged to spend extended time enjoying diverse facilities, dining, shopping, and entertainment.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Timing Your Stops

**Service Area Spacing:** With major facilities approximately 50 km apart and parking areas every 15-20 km, plan breaks based on comfort rather than availability - facilities are plentiful.

**Recommended Stop Duration:**
- Quick break (restroom, vending): 10-15 minutes at parking areas
- Standard break (restroom, coffee, browse): 20-30 minutes at service areas
- Extended break (meal, shopping, observation): 45-60 minutes at EXPASA facilities

### Route-Specific Recommendations

**For One-Stop Strategy:**
Choose either Ebina SA (early break, 40-45 minutes from Tokyo) or Ashigara SA (later break, closer to Gotemba with Mount Fuji views). Ebina offers more comprehensive facilities and food options; Ashigara provides better mountain viewing and a more relaxed atmosphere.

**For Two-Stop Strategy:**
Brief stop at Ebina SA (coffee, restroom, quick snack) + Extended break at Ashigara SA (meal, observation deck, photography). This approach balances early-journey refreshment with scenic enjoyment closer to the destination.

**Alternative Viewing Stop:**
Consider Komakado PA for a quick Mount Fuji photography stop if skipping other facilities.

### Best Photo Spots

**Mount Fuji Photography:**
1. Ashigara SA observation deck - Comprehensive Fuji views
2. Komakado PA - Intimate mountain perspectives with low infrastructure
3. Best light: Morning (before 10 AM) provides best clarity and softer shadows

**Politeness:** Greet staff with "konnichiwa" and thank with "arigato gozaimasu"

### Traffic Conditions

While October 23, 2025 (Thursday) should experience lighter weekday traffic, autumn foliage season can increase highway usage. Early morning departures help avoid congestion.
