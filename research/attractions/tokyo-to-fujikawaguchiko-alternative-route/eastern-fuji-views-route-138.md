**Location:** Kagosaka Pass and Route 138 corridor, Shizuoka/Yamanashi border
**Category:** Scenic drive with viewing opportunities
**Cost:** Free (public roadway)
**Best Time:** Early morning for clearest views
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes for dedicated photo stops
**Research Completed:** September 30, 2025

## Basic Information

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This research was originally titled "Izu Peninsula approach views" in the discovery phase, but that name is geographically misleading. The Izu Peninsula is 50-70 minutes one-way from Gotemba (separate half-day excursion), not a route stop. The legitimate attraction is the **eastern Mount Fuji perspectives visible from Route 138**, particularly around Kagosaka Pass.

The eastern approach along Route 138 between Gotemba and Lake Yamanakako offers genuinely unique Mount Fuji views distinguished by clear visibility of the **Hoei Crater** - a massive parasitic crater on the mountain's southeastern flank that is completely invisible from the northern Fuji Five Lakes perspectives.

## The Eastern Perspective: What Makes It Unique

### Hoei Crater Visibility

The defining feature of eastern views is the clear visibility of the 1707 Hoei Crater (ÂÆùÊ∞∏Â§ßÂô¥ÁÅ´Âè£), a massive parasitic crater formed during the catastrophic 1707 eruption on Mount Fuji's southeastern flank. The Hoei eruption lasted from December 16, 1707 to February 24, 1708, creating three aligned vents that produced a crater reaching 2,693 meters elevation with a maximum diameter of 1.3 kilometers - larger than the summit crater itself. [üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H≈çei_eruption)

Viewed from the southeast, this "excrescence" represents what some describe as Mount Fuji's "least admired" view aesthetically, as it breaks the mountain's otherwise symmetrical cone profile. However, it offers unmatched geological and historical significance, providing direct visual evidence of Japan's most recent major volcanic eruption. [üîó](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-been-more-than-300-years-since-japans-breathtaking-mount-fuji-last-erupted-180985613/)

**Why This Matters:** The Hoei Crater is completely invisible from Lake Kawaguchiko and all northern viewpoints. Travelers who only experience Mount Fuji from the Fuji Five Lakes area never see this dramatic geological feature. The eastern approach provides the only roadside opportunity to witness this unique volcanic landscape.

### Geographic Advantages

The eastern approach offers:
- More symmetrical cone profile than northern views (when viewed from optimal angles)
- Foreground featuring forested highlands and Gotemba plains rather than lake reflections
- Different aesthetic from iconic Lake Kawaguchiko postcard images
- Unobstructed panoramas from highland elevation (Kagosaka Pass at 1,104 meters)
- Natural integration into driving route - no detour required

## Primary Viewing Location: Kagosaka Pass

**Kagosaka Pass (Á±†ÂùÇÂ≥†)** represents the premier viewing location for eastern Mount Fuji perspectives along Route 138. Located at the border between Shizuoka and Yamanashi prefectures at 1,104 meters elevation, this mountain pass offers the first dramatic, unobstructed views of Mount Fuji as travelers ascend from Gotemba toward Lake Yamanakako. [üîó](https://hikeshizuoka.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/kagosaka-touge-Á±†ÂùÇÂ≥†-hiking-course/)

**Cultural Significance:** Kagosaka Pass (also known historically as Mishima Pass) connected Kofu through the pass to Mishima via Gotemba, serving as an important transportation route. The location was immortalized in Katsushika Hokusai's famous woodblock print "Mishima Pass in Kai Province" from the Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji series (circa 1831), depicting a giant tree overshadowing Mount Fuji with travelers in the foreground.

## Visiting Information

**Access:**
- **By Car:** Direct route on National Route 138 between Gotemba IC and Lake Yamanakako
- **Distance from Gotemba IC:** Approximately 20 minutes drive (naturally part of route to Fujikawaguchiko)
- **Parking:** Limited roadside pull-offs; small parking area near Yamanakako Village Public Cemetery (8 spaces, free, with toilets - closed in winter)
  - **Note:** Cemetery parking not intended for tourist use; respect local sensibilities
- **Bus Access:** Fujikyuko bus from Gotemba Station to Kagosaka Pass, hourly service, 33 minutes, ¬•980 [üîó](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Gotemba-Station/Kagosaka-Pass)

**Practical Details:**
- **Hours:** Public road - accessible 24/7 (winter weather conditions may affect visibility)
- **Admission:** Free (public roadway)
- **Best Time:** Early morning for clearest views; October offers good visibility before peak winter viewing season
- **Typical Duration:** 15-30 minutes for photo stops
- **Facilities:** Minimal - limited parking, no dedicated observation facilities
- **Current Status:** Open year-round (check weather conditions)

## The Viewing Experience

**Transient Beauty:**
Route 138 between Gotemba and Lake Yamanakako provides multiple spontaneous viewing opportunities as Mount Fuji gradually reveals itself during the ascent through the mountain pass. The eastern approach creates an unfolding discovery experience rather than a single observation point.

**Photography Opportunities:**
- **Hoei Crater Focus:** Best photographed with telephoto lenses (200mm+) to capture crater detail from Route 138 viewpoints
- **Composition:** The foreground typically features forested highlands creating a layered landscape effect
- **Lighting:** Afternoon backlighting emphasizes the mountain's profile; morning offers side-lighting from the south
- **Unique Element:** The Hoei Crater provides a distinctive compositional element unavailable in any northern/lake-based perspectives

**Comparison with Lake Kawaguchiko Views:**
- **Eastern = Geological Interest:** Focus on Hoei Crater and volcanic history; more rugged, less "postcard perfect"
- **Northern = Iconic Aesthetics:** Lake reflections, "inverted Fuji," classic symmetrical compositions
- **Value Assessment:** Eastern views complement rather than replace northern perspectives; travelers experience both by following the route

## Practical Visiting Tips

**October 23, 2025 Considerations:**
- **October Visibility:** Good visibility conditions but not peak season (November-March offers clearest views)
- **Weather:** Early autumn weather generally stable; morning viewing recommended before afternoon clouds develop
- **Foliage:** Some autumn color beginning to appear in highland areas around Kagosaka Pass
- **Crowds:** Moderate tourist activity; significantly less crowded than peak winter viewing months

**Viewing Strategy:**
- **Flexible Stopping:** Be prepared to stop opportunistically when Mount Fuji visibility is excellent during the drive
- **Safety First:** Use roadside pull-offs safely; avoid blocking traffic or creating hazards
- **Parking Caution:** Limited formal parking; plan for brief stops rather than extended viewing sessions
- **Hoei Crater Recognition:** Study images of the crater before your visit to fully appreciate this unique geological feature when you see it

**Weather and Preparation:**
- **Morning Priority:** October mornings offer best visibility before afternoon clouds develop over the mountain
- **Backup Flexibility:** Have alternate route timing ready if weather temporarily obscures mountain views
- **October Clothing:** Bring layers; highland pass areas (1,104m elevation) significantly cooler than Gotemba lowlands
- **Photography Gear:** Telephoto lens recommended for Hoei Crater detail; wide-angle for broader landscape compositions

## Route Integration

**Strategic Value:**
The eastern approach views are **naturally integrated into the Tokyo to Fujikawaguchiko Alternative Route** via Route 138. Unlike other "Major Detour" attractions, this requires **no additional detour time** - it's simply part of the drive. The 15-30 minutes for dedicated photo stops is entirely optional; travelers can enjoy views while driving.

**Already-Researched Complementary Perspectives:**
- **Gotemba Premium Outlets:** Already researched; offers eastern Mount Fuji views from shopping complex
- **Subashiri Trail Area:** Already researched; provides access to southeastern Mount Fuji perspectives
- **Lake Yamanakako:** Already researched; first of Fuji Five Lakes with southern shore views showing different angles

**Time Investment:**
- **Minimal Additional Time:** 15-30 minutes maximum for dedicated stops at Kagosaka Pass
- **High Uniqueness Factor:** Hoei Crater perspective unavailable from any other researched viewpoint
- **Geographic Efficiency:** Natural part of driving route, not a detour

**Recommended Integration:**
Include Kagosaka Pass as a brief scheduled stop (or flexible opportunistic stop) during the Gotemba to Fujikawaguchiko drive. This adds cultural context (Hokusai connection) and unique geological perspectives (Hoei Crater) without meaningful time cost.

## Important Notes

**Category Clarification:**
This research item was originally named "Izu Peninsula approach views" in the discovery phase, which is **geographically misleading**. The Izu Peninsula proper is located 50-70 minutes south of Gotemba (100-140 minutes round trip), requiring a separate half-day excursion of 4-5 hours total including facility time. [üîó](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Gotemba/Izu)

The legitimate attraction for route planning purposes is the **"Eastern Fuji Views from Route 138"** naturally experienced while driving, particularly around Kagosaka Pass.

**Izu Panorama Park (Not Route-Viable):**
While Izu Panorama Park (offering exceptional coastal Mount Fuji views) exists in northern Izu Peninsula, it represents a completely separate destination requiring 50-70 minutes one-way driving from Gotemba, plus 1-2 hours at the facility. This is **not a reasonable "Major Detour" for travelers heading to Fujikawaguchiko** and should only be considered if planning a dedicated Izu Peninsula excursion. [üîó](https://www.panoramapark.co.jp/en)

**Weather Dependency:**
All Mount Fuji viewing is heavily weather-dependent. October offers good but not peak visibility conditions (November-March is statistically best). Morning viewing strongly recommended before afternoon cloud development.

**No Facilities Warning:**
Unlike developed observation points with dedicated parking, restaurants, and restrooms, Kagosaka Pass is simply a mountain pass on a public highway with limited pull-off areas. Plan accordingly for minimal facilities.
