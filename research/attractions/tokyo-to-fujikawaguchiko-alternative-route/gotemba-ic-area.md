Gotemba Interchange (IC) on the Tomei Expressway serves as the primary southern gateway to Mount Fuji, marking the transition from high-speed expressway travel to scenic regional roads toward the Fujikawaguchiko area. This interchange is particularly notable as the highest point on the Tomei Expressway at 454 meters elevation, making it prone to severe snowfall and climate changes during winter months (though October conditions are typically mild). [🔗](https://www.c-nexco.co.jp/en/special/snow/needed.html)

Gotemba IC represents the pivotal moment where your journey transitions from Tokyo's urban expressway network to the scenic regional roads of the Mount Fuji area. This southern approach offers dramatic views of Mount Fuji's massive southern base and volcanic flows, showcasing a different character than the resort-like atmosphere of Kawaguchiko. [🔗](gemini research)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Gotemba's role as a gateway is deeply rooted in Japan's transportation history. Situated on the ancient Tokaido Road that connected Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto, the area has long served as a transit point for travelers. Its importance grew significantly with the opening of Gotemba Station in 1889, solidifying its status as a base for accessing Mount Fuji. [🔗](gemini research)

The Tomei Expressway, which began operations on May 26, 1969, established Gotemba IC as a critical access point for the southern approach to Mount Fuji. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashigara_Service_Area)

For centuries, climbing Mount Fuji has been a spiritual pilgrimage, and Gotemba serves as the starting point for the **Gotemba Trail**, the longest and least crowded of the four main climbing routes. This trail starts at the lowest elevation, offering a more traditional and physically demanding ascent. [🔗](gemini research)

### Regional Character

The Gotemba area feels more "local" and less polished than the resort-like atmosphere of Kawaguchiko. It's a working town with a deep connection to the mountain, featuring more agricultural land and residential areas than the tourist-centric Five Lakes region. [🔗](gemini research) The town presents a mix of older Japanese buildings and modern roadside stores, all under the ever-present gaze of Mount Fuji.

Mount Fuji can be seen from almost anywhere in Gotemba, including from the city's popular outlet shopping mall. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6933.html) The views from this southern approach are dramatic and expansive, showcasing the mountain's massive base and volcanic flows. [🔗](gemini research)
