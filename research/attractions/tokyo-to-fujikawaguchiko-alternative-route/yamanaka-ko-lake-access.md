Lake Yamanaka is the largest and highest of the Fuji Five Lakes, serving as a natural, less-developed alternative entry point to the Five Lakes region when traveling from Gotemba to Fujikawaguchiko along Route 138. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Yamanaka)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Largest surface area among Five Lakes: ~6.4 square km
- Highest elevation: 980.5m (3,217 ft) - third highest lake in Japan
- Shallow depth (max 13.5m) creates excellent reflection conditions
- Only Five Lake with natural outflow (drained by Sagami River)
- Informally known as "Swan Lake" for whooping swan population

The lake was designated part of the Mount Fuji UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013, recognizing its cultural and spiritual significance in relation to Mount Fuji worship traditions dating to the late 16th century. [ðŸ”—](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1418/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Lake Yamanaka offers a distinctly different character compared to Lake Kawaguchi - more expansive, open atmosphere with superior natural beauty and less commercialized surroundings. As the highest of the Five Lakes, it provides unique perspectives on Mount Fuji from an elevated vantage point. [ðŸ”—](https://japanstartshere.com/2025/01/27/yamanakako-vs-kawaguchiko/)

The lake's shallow depth and calm morning conditions make it famous for "Sakasa Fuji" (upside-down Fuji) reflection photography. October's clear autumn air creates ideal conditions for these mirror-image reflections. [ðŸ”—](https://yugakurita.com/blog/2020/01/05/yamanakako/)
