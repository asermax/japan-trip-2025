Shimazaki Sake Brewery (島崎酒造), established in 1849 during the late Edo period, has been producing traditional sake for over 170 years in the peaceful countryside of Nasukarasuyama, near the Nakagawa River. [🔗](https://nearbytokyo.com/shimazaki-sake-brewery/) The brewery is renowned throughout Japan as "The Cave Brewery" (洞窟酒蔵) due to its unique use of a WWII-era underground tunnel system for aging premium sake. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/experiences-in-japan/1552/)

The 600-meter cave was originally excavated by hand during the final months of World War II as a planned underground factory for manufacturing military tanks, but the war ended before the facility could be used for its intended purpose. [🔗](https://sakevoyage.com/the-breweries/shimazaki/) In 1970, the declassified cave (originally 800 meters deep) was procured by Shimazaki Shuzo for sake storage, transforming what was once a symbol of war into a sanctuary for Japan's traditional brewing culture. [🔗](https://azumarikishi.co.jp/en/about/)

The cave's natural conditions create an ideal environment for aging sake: a constant temperature of approximately 10°C (50°F) year-round, complete darkness untouched by sunlight, and slight temperature variations that cause gentle fluctuation in the sake, allowing for superior maturation. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/experiences-in-japan/1552/) Around 100,000 bottles of primarily daiginjo sake rest in the jet-black cave, with the oldest vintages dating back to 1970.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Pioneer of Aged Sake (Koshu) Production

Shimazaki Shuzo pioneered aged sake (koshu) production in Japan, focusing on daiginjo varieties and accumulating over 50 years of experience as one of the country's first dedicated aged sake breweries. [🔗](https://azumarikishi.co.jp/en/about/) While most sake is consumed within a year of production, Shimazaki challenged conventional wisdom by demonstrating that premium daiginjo sake could develop exceptional complexity through long-term cave aging.

### IWC Trophy and International Recognition

Their flagship aged sake brand "Uroko" (熟露枯) won the coveted IWC (International Wine Challenge) Trophy in 2018 for their Daiginjo Uroko 10 Years Aged (2007 vintage), selected from among 1,639 challengers. [🔗](https://sake-uroko.com/en/) The golden-brown sake exhibits elegant complexity created by decade-long maturation in the cool cave environment, earning international recognition for Japanese aged sake traditions.

### Transformation from War to Cultural Preservation

The juxtaposition of wartime history and traditional brewing culture creates a unique narrative—what was intended as a military production facility became a temple for preserving and perfecting Japan's national drink. The hand-excavated tunnels serve as a tangible reminder of Japan's transformation from wartime destruction to cultural preservation and refinement. This symbolic transformation resonates deeply with Japanese concepts of regeneration and peaceful purpose.

### Azuma Rikishi Brand Heritage

The brewery produces sake under the brand name "Azuma Rikishi" (東力士), using local Tochigi rice and pure mountain spring water. [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1246/) "Azuma" refers to the eastern regions of Japan, while "Rikishi" means sumo wrestler, conveying strength and tradition. Beyond their award-winning aged daiginjo, they craft various sake types and specialty products including yuzu, strawberry, and ume plum liqueurs, as well as sake ice cream.

[🔗](https://azumarikishi.co.jp/tour/) The experience immerses you in complete darkness where 100,000 bottles rest in rows along the cave walls, creating an atmospheric journey through Japan's sake aging tradition.

The cave's interior reveals:
- Hand-excavated tunnel walls showcasing WWII-era construction

- Historical displays about cave origins and sake aging science
- Atmospheric lighting highlighting key aging sections

The complete darkness and consistent temperature create an almost meditative atmosphere, allowing visitors to appreciate the patience required for decade-long aging processes.

The brewery offers guided tasting sessions in their VIP room featuring premium aged sake varieties. The ¥3,550 tasting includes three aged sake selections, often featuring different vintages of their award-winning Uroko daiginjo.

The hand-excavation required extraordinary labor during wartime - imagining this effort being redirected to sake preservation highlights the contrast between destruction and cultural refinement.
