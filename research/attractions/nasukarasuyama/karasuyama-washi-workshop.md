Karasuyama Washi Workshop (Washi-no-Sato / 和紙の里), operated by Fukuda Paper Mill, represents the last surviving producer of Karasuyama washi, a 1,200-year-old papermaking tradition dating to the Nara period (710-794 AD). [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1339/) This hands-on cultural experience allows visitors to learn traditional Japanese papermaking techniques that have been designated as a national intangible cultural property since 1977. [🔗](https://tochigi-dentoukougeihin.info/en/othercrafts/karasuyama-tesuki-washi.html)

Currently, only Fukuda Paper Mill continues to produce this paper using traditional hand-making methods in a quiet mountain village, about 10-15 minutes by car from the Karasuyama Washi Kaikan in the city. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kanto/tochigi/nikkou/atelier/) The workshop at Washi-no-Sato preserves techniques where rare Nasu kozo (paper mulberry) serves as the raw material. All stages of production—from boiling the raw materials to papermaking and drying—are completed by hand using methods unchanged for over a millennium. [🔗](https://www.tochigiji.or.jp/spot/s6622)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### 1,200-Year Heritage from Nara Period

Karasuyama washi papermaking has been passed down by artisans in Nasukarasuyama since the Nara period (710-794 AD), formerly known as Nasu paper and renowned throughout Japan as thick, high-quality paper. [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1339/) This millennium-spanning tradition places Karasuyama washi among Japan's oldest continuously practiced crafts, predating the samurai era and surviving through centuries of political and cultural upheaval.

### National Intangible Cultural Property Designation

This dedication to traditional craftsmanship earned Karasuyama Tesuki-washi designation as a national intangible cultural property in 1977. [🔗](https://tochigi-dentoukougeihin.info/en/othercrafts/karasuyama-tesuki-washi.html) The recognition acknowledges both the technical mastery required and the cultural importance of preserving these ancient papermaking methods in an age of industrial paper production.

### Modern Cultural Applications

The paper varieties produced include hodomura-shi, santome-gami, oshie-gami, and some-gami, each serving different traditional and modern purposes. [🔗](https://tochigi-dentoukougeihin.info/en/othercrafts/karasuyama-tesuki-washi.html) Karasuyama washi continues to be used for important cultural applications, including:

- **School graduation diplomas** throughout Tochigi Prefecture and beyond
- **Harikayama paper mountain backgrounds** for the UNESCO-recognized Yamaage Festival
- **Traditional art and calligraphy** preservation
- **Document restoration** for historical archives [🔗](https://nearbytokyo.com/things-to-do-in-nasu-karasuyama/)

### Preservation Challenges and Community Role

According to Fukuda Hiroko, the mill's representative, workshops are popular with families and groups, with local elementary students often experiencing traditional papermaking as part of their education. Karasuyama High School maintains a tradition where third-year students hand-make their own graduation certificates. [🔗](https://www.tochigiji.or.jp/spot/s6622) This educational integration helps ensure the tradition's continuation by fostering appreciation among younger generations.

## The Workshop Experience

### Factory Observation

Visitors can observe the complete traditional papermaking process up close, witnessing every step from boiling raw Nasu kozo paper material to the final drying stages. [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1339/) All processes are conducted by hand using techniques preserved for 1,200 years, providing rare insight into this endangered craft.

The "nagashi-zuki" technique, unique to Japanese papermaking, involves shaking the papermaking screen in specific patterns to align fibers and create exceptionally strong, durable paper. This method distinguishes Japanese washi from Chinese and Korean papermaking traditions, producing paper with superior tear resistance and longevity.
