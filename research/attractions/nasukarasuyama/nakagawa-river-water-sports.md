The Nakagawa River (Naka River, 那珂川) near Nasukarasuyama City offers a remarkable outdoor recreation experience in one of the Kanto region's most pristine natural settings. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/47384) The river originates from the Nasu Mountain Range and flows approximately 150 km through Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures before reaching the Pacific Ocean at Oarai. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40518)

The Miyahara district of Nasukarasuyama, where most water sports activities are centered, is celebrated as the "Arashiyama of Kanto" (関東の嵐山) for its picturesque scenery that rivals Kyoto's famous Arashiyama district. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/47384) The comparison derives from the exceptional combination of clear-flowing river, surrounding mountains, and spectacular fall foliage reflected in the water.

## Cultural & Natural Significance

### Ecological Importance

The Naka River holds unique ecological and cultural importance in the Kanto region. With water quality that rivals even Shikoku's renowned Shimanto River, the Nakagawa supports over 50 species of fish and serves as a critical habitat for plants, birds, and aquatic life. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naka_River_(Tochigi_Ibaraki))

Since the Edo Period, the river has been recognized as the **southernmost river in Japan where wild salmon migrate upstream to spawn**, making it an important ecological boundary. From October through December, natural chum salmon swim upriver from the sea to their spawning grounds, offering visitors a rare opportunity to witness this phenomenon in the Kanto region. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505)

### Historical Significance

The river's historical significance extends beyond ecology. Its high-quality, clean groundwater has been essential for producing Karasuyama Washi, a traditional handmade paper with over 1,200 years of history that was officially used by the Tokugawa shogunate. Historically, the river served as a vital waterway for transporting goods, including rice, between the northern Tohoku region and Edo (modern-day Tokyo).

The pristine environmental condition stands in contrast to other rivers in the Kanto plain that have been heavily impacted by urban development, making the Nakagawa a precious natural resource.
