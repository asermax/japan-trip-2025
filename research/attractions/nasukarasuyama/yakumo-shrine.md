Yakumo Shrine (å…«é›²ç¥žç¤¾, Yakumo-jinja) is a historic Shinto shrine established in 1560 when Nasu Sukitane, lord of Karasuyama Castle, enshrined Gozu Tenno (ç‰›é ­å¤©çŽ‹) at Nakamachi Jumonji to pray for the elimination of epidemics, bountiful harvests, and peace throughout the world. [ðŸ”—](https://www.trip.com/moments/theme/destination-nasukarasuyama-56726-attractions-993137/) In 1870, Gozu Tenno Shrine was renamed Yakumo Shrine.

The shrine is affectionately called "Yakumo-sama" by local residents and is dedicated to Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the Shinto deity associated with storms, seas, and protection. [ðŸ”—](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/41363/) Visitors pray here for physical health, recovery from illness, safe travels, and protection from misfortune. [ðŸ”—](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695)

Located in the heart of Nasukarasuyama's old castle town, just north of the Nasukarasuyama City Hall Karasuyama Office, the shrine occupies a central position both geographically and culturally. [ðŸ”—](http://www.komainu.org/tochigi/nasukarasuyamasi/yakumo/yakumo.html) The surrounding streets retain the atmosphere of a historic castle town, with traditional architecture and narrow lanes that evoke the Edo period when the Nasu clan ruled from nearby Karasuyama Castle.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Yakumo Shrine stands as a testament to the Nasu clan's spiritual and cultural legacy in the Karasuyama region. The shrine's founding in 1560 coincided with a period of epidemic disease, prompting Lord Nasu Sukitane to establish a sacred space dedicated to Gozu Tenno, a deity believed to ward off plague and pestilence. This act of spiritual protection for his people demonstrated the intertwining of political authority and religious responsibility that characterized feudal Japan.

The shrine's transformation from Gozu Tenno Shrine to Yakumo Shrine in 1870 reflects the religious and political changes of the Meiji Restoration period, when many shrines underwent name changes and reorganization as part of the government's Shinto revival policies. Despite this administrative shift, the shrine maintained its core purpose as a guardian of community health and prosperity.

Yakumo Shrine's most famous association is with the Yama-age Festival (Yamaage Matsuri), a spectacular celebration that has been designated as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. This 460-year-old festival transforms the shrine into the epicenter of one of Japan's most extraordinary traditional performing arts events. [ðŸ”—](https://www.jtco.or.jp/en/japanese-culture/?act=detail&id=123&p=0&c=23)

The festival begins at 5:00 AM when the mikoshi (portable shrine) departs from a temporary shrine and processes through the town, returning to Yakumo Shrine around 11:00 PM in a ceremony called "Omiya-iri" (entering the shrine). [ðŸ”—](https://japanguides.net/tochigi/nasukarasuyama-karasuyama-yama-age-festival/) The entire town becomes a stage for traditional performances, with locals dressed in historical costumes reenacting the legendary story of a three-legged crow that helped a military commander find the perfect location to build Karasuyama Castle.
