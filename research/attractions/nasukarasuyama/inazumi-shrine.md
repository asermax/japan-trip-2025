## Basic Information

Inazumi Shrine (稲積神社, Inazumi-jinja) is a historic Shinto shrine founded in 1165 (永万元年, first year of Eiman) during the Heian period when Sudo Munesuke (also known as Nasu Munekata) moved from Kanda Castle and established the shrine by enshrining Inazumi Daimyojin, a deity he had worshipped during his period of exile in Kai Province (present-day Yamanashi Prefecture). [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695) [🔗](https://hotokami.jp/area/tochigi/Htgty/Htgtytr/Dmzkr/84322/)

The shrine occupies a position of profound historical significance as it was revered as "the guardian deity of the Nasu clan" and continued to be worshipped and protected by successive feudal lords beyond the Nasu family through the centuries. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695) The shrine was built within the grounds of Inazumi Castle, which is deeply connected to the grandfather of Nasu no Yoichi, the legendary samurai archer famous for his extraordinary feat during the Battle of Yashima in 1185.

The shrine preserves remarkable cultural treasures including the Yang Guifei Votive Painting (designated as Tochigi Prefecture cultural property), the Tomoe Gozen Votive Painting (Nasukarasuyama City cultural asset), and the Han Xin Passing Between the Legs votive painting (Nasukarasuyama City cultural asset).

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Inazumi Shrine represents one of the most historically significant religious sites in the Nasukarasuyama region, predating even the establishment of Yakumo Shrine by nearly 400 years. The shrine's founding in 1165 connects it to the turbulent late Heian period when the Nasu clan was consolidating its power in the region following service to the Minamoto clan and the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karasuyama_Castle)

The shrine's location within Inazumi Castle grounds highlights the intimate relationship between military power and spiritual protection that characterized feudal Japan. Inazumi Castle served as a stronghold for the Nasu clan, and the shrine functioned as the spiritual guardian of both the fortress and the clan itself. This positioning made Inazumi Shrine more than a place of worship - it was an integral component of the clan's political and military strategy, providing divine legitimacy and protection for their rule.

### Connection to Nasu no Yoichi

The shrine's connection to Nasu no Yoichi adds legendary dimension to its historical significance. Nasu no Yoichi remains one of Japan's most celebrated warriors, immortalized in the epic Tale of the Heike for his incredible archery skill at the Battle of Yashima during the Genpei War (1180-1185). With wind whipping and from horseback on rolling waves, Yoichi succeeded in shooting a folding fan from atop a pole on an enemy ship - a feat that demonstrated supernatural skill and brought great honor to the Nasu clan. [🔗](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/nasu-no-yoichi/m06ldd7?hl=en) The shrine's connection to his grandfather establishes it as a pilgrimage site for those interested in this legendary figure.

### Architectural and Cultural Heritage

The current main hall (本殿, honden) represents exceptional Edo period craftsmanship. Built in the Ichimonji-nagare-zukuri style (一文字流造り), a form of flowing roof architecture, the structure is thought to date from the early Edo period. The main hall stands as a small but elegantly proportioned building constructed on natural stone foundations, demonstrating traditional shrine construction techniques that have endured for centuries. [🔗](https://www.city.nasukarasuyama.lg.jp/page/page001675.html)

The shrine preserves remarkable cultural treasures that attract scholars and history enthusiasts from across Japan:

**Yang Guifei Votive Painting (楊貴妃の絵馬):** Designated as a cultural property of Tochigi Prefecture, this votive tablet depicts Yang Guifei, one of ancient China's "Four Beauties" and the beloved consort of Tang Dynasty Emperor Xuanzong. The presence of such a sophisticated Chinese cultural reference in a rural Japanese shrine reflects the cosmopolitan education and cultural sophistication of the samurai class who patronized the shrine. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695)

**Tomoe Gozen Votive Painting (巴御前の絵馬):** Designated as a cultural asset of Nasukarasuyama City, this painting honors Tomoe Gozen, the legendary female samurai who fought in the Genpei War alongside Minamoto no Yoshinaka. Her inclusion connects the shrine to the same historical period as Nasu no Yoichi and demonstrates the shrine's role in preserving stories of martial valor. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695)

**Han Xin Passing Between the Legs (韓信股くぐりの絵馬):** Also designated as a Nasukarasuyama City cultural asset, this votive painting depicts the famous story of Han Xin, the brilliant military strategist of the Han Dynasty who endured humiliation as a youth by crawling between a bully's legs rather than fighting. This tale of strategic thinking and enduring short-term shame for long-term success held particular resonance for the samurai class. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695)

These votive paintings collectively demonstrate the shrine's function as a repository of warrior ethics and strategic wisdom - Chinese and Japanese historical examples that provided moral and tactical instruction for the samurai families who worshipped here.

### Religious Continuity and Feudal Patronage

Inazumi Shrine's designation as the guardian deity of the Nasu clan established its central importance in the region's spiritual landscape. What makes the shrine particularly significant is that this guardianship extended beyond the Nasu family itself - successive feudal lords who governed the region after the Nasu clan's displacement in 1590 continued to worship and protect the shrine. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695) This continuity speaks to the shrine's deep roots in local religious consciousness and its transcendence of particular political regimes.

The Ichimonji-nagare-zukuri style main hall represents excellent Edo period shrine architecture. Built on natural stone foundations, the structure demonstrates traditional construction techniques and elegant proportions characteristic of early Edo craftsmanship. Visitors should observe the flowing roof line (nagare-zukuri) that extends protectively over the worship area, as well as the integration of the building with its natural stone base. [🔗](https://www.city.nasukarasuyama.lg.jp/page/page001675.html)

**Votive Painting Treasures:**
The shrine houses three remarkable votive tablet paintings (絵馬, ema) that represent significant cultural properties. These paintings combine artistic skill with moral and historical instruction. Access to view these cultural properties may require advance arrangement with shrine authorities or the Nasukarasuyama City Cultural Properties Office.

**Inazumi Castle Ruins Context:**
The shrine's location on the grounds of former Inazumi Castle provides historical context for understanding its role as a guardian shrine. The 6th generation lord of the Nasu clan moved to Inazumi Castle from their earlier stronghold, establishing this site as a major center of clan power. Exploring the castle ruins area (north of the current shrine) helps visitors understand the integrated military-spiritual complex that characterized feudal Japanese governance. [🔗](https://skyticket.com/guide/57695)

**Quiet Contemplation:**
Unlike the more accessible and frequently visited Yakumo Shrine in central Nasukarasuyama, Inazumi Shrine's remote location in Shimozakai district offers visitors a quieter, more meditative experience. The shrine maintains the atmosphere of a rural guardian shrine (chinju-sama) that has watched over the local community for centuries.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Best Photo Spots:**
- Main shrine hall from approach path, showing Ichimonji-nagare-zukuri architecture
- Natural stone foundations demonstrating traditional construction
- Wider landscape shots showing the shrine's integration into rural Shimozakai
- Castle ruins area providing historical context

**Crowd Avoidance Strategies:**
The shrine's remote location naturally limits visitor numbers. Outside of the August Sasara Lion Dance festival, expect a peaceful atmosphere with primarily local worshippers. This makes Inazumi Shrine ideal for visitors seeking quieter, more contemplative historical experiences away from tourist crowds.

**Money-Saving Options:**
Shrine admission is free with donations accepted. The primary expense is taxi transportation from Karasuyama Station (approximately 20 minutes). Visitors with rental cars can include the shrine as part of a broader exploration of rural Tochigi, combining it with other off-the-beaten-path historical sites.

**Local Etiquette:**
Follow standard Shinto shrine protocols:
- Bow before passing through any torii gate
- Use the purification fountain (chozuya) if available
- Approach the main shrine with respect, make offerings, bow twice, clap twice, pray, bow once
- Speak quietly and maintain respectful behavior
- Remember this is an active shrine serving the local Shimozakai community

**Cultural Property Viewing:**
To view the designated cultural property votive paintings, advance contact with shrine authorities or the Nasukarasuyama City Cultural Properties Office is recommended. These treasures may not be on permanent public display and may require special arrangements for viewing. Contact: Nasukarasuyama City Board of Education, Cultural Properties Section.

**Historical Context Preparation:**
Visitors will gain significantly more from the experience by researching:
- Nasu no Yoichi and his legendary archery at the Battle of Yashima
- The Genpei War and formation of the Kamakura Shogunate
- The Nasu clan's role in supporting the Minamoto clan
- The significance of Yang Guifei, Tomoe Gozen, and Han Xin in warrior education

**Transportation Planning:** The shrine's location in the Shimozakai district requires careful transportation planning. Taxi service from Karasuyama Station (approximately 20 minutes) is the most reliable option for visitors without personal vehicles. Confirm taxi availability and consider arranging return transportation in advance, as the rural location may have limited taxi service.

**Combined Visit Strategy:** Given the taxi transportation required, consider combining the Inazumi Shrine visit with exploration of the Inazumi Castle ruins and other sites in the Shimozakai area to maximize the value of the journey. The shrine visit itself requires 30-45 minutes, but allow 1.5-2 hours total including transportation and castle ruins exploration.
