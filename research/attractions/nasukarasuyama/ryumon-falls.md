Ryumon Falls (龍門の滝, "Dragon Gate Falls") is a wide, dramatic waterfall measuring approximately 20 meters in height and 65 meters in width, spanning the Egawa River in Nasukarasuyama, Tochigi Prefecture. [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1836/) The waterfall's most distinctive feature is the JR Karasuyama Line railway passing directly behind the falls, creating iconic photography opportunities with trains framed against cascading water. [🔗](https://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/waterfalls/asia-ryumon-waterfall/)

The name "Dragon Gate Falls" derives from a legend that large snakes inhabit the site. Halfway down the cascade are two distinctive vertical holes called Ogama ("Male Cauldron") with a 4-meter diameter and Megama ("Female Cauldron") at 2 meters diameter, which according to folklore are the dwelling places of these legendary creatures.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The waterfall's dragon legend connects to broader Japanese water mythology, where serpents and dragons are believed to inhabit waterfalls and protect water sources. [🔗](https://www.guidoor.jp/en/places/5060/) The Ogama and Megama formations represent male and female spiritual energies, a common motif in Japanese sacred geography where paired natural features symbolize cosmic balance and fertility.

The site maintains spiritual connections through its proximity to 1,200-year-old Taiheiji Temple, located just beyond the falls along the walking trail. The temple features impressive Nio guardian statues at its Niomon Gate, integrating Buddhist protection with the waterfall's indigenous water spirits.

The falls gained modern cultural significance as a favorite photography subject, particularly when seasonal elements—cherry blossoms in spring, vibrant autumn foliage, or winter snow—combine with passing trains to create quintessentially Japanese landscape compositions.
