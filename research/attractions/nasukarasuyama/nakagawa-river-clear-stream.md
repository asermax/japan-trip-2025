The Nakagawa River (also written as Naka River) in Nasukarasuyama City represents one of the Kanto region's most pristine waterways, earning its nickname "Arashiyama of Kanto" for picturesque scenery reminiscent of Kyoto's famous district. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505) Originating from Mount Nasu in Nikko National Park, this Class 1 river flows 150 kilometers through Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naka_River_(Tochigi_Ibaraki))

The river's exceptional clarity has made it renowned as "the best clear stream in the Kanto area." [🔗](https://www.tnap.jp/english/index.php) This pristine water quality supports an impressive ecosystem with more than 50 species of fish, including dace, chum salmon, ayu (sweetfish), and herring. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505)

The Miyahara district section near Nasukarasuyama features wide meanders and large natural flows that retain an "old-fashioned natural landscape" with abundant untouched nature. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505) The river's calm current in this area makes it ideal for various water activities while allowing close observation of the natural environment and wildlife.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

**Historical & Cultural Recognition:**

The river achieved cultural recognition by lending its name to the Japanese cruiser *Naka*, reflecting its importance in Japanese history. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naka_River_(Tochigi_Ibaraki)) The surrounding Nakagawa Prefectural Natural Park protects the area's ecological value, particularly at locations like Mount Kamakura, which rises 100 meters above the river and offers spectacular views during autumn. [🔗](https://www.visit-tochigi.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/1256/)

**"Arashiyama of Kanto" Designation:**

The comparison to Kyoto's famous Arashiyama district elevates the Nakagawa River beyond a simple natural feature to a cultural landmark. This designation recognizes not only the river's physical beauty but also its role in preserving natural river landscapes increasingly rare in modern Japan. The nickname implies similar aesthetic values: pristine water quality, scenic natural beauty, seasonal transformations (particularly autumn foliage), and contemplative atmosphere conducive to nature appreciation.

**Salmon Migration Cultural Significance:**

From October through December, natural chum salmon migrate from the sea to spawn in the Nakagawa River's clear waters. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505) This natural phenomenon represents the river's ecological health and connects to broader Japanese cultural appreciation for seasonal natural events (季節の移ろい, *kisetsu no utsuroi*). The salmon's life cycle—born in rivers, living in the ocean, returning to birth rivers to spawn—resonates with Japanese concepts of home, journey, and return.

Salmon viewing offers "lots of moving scenes" as wild salmon navigate upstream. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505) This spectacle connects visitors to ancient Japanese fishing traditions and the spiritual significance of rivers as life-giving forces.

**Environmental Conservation:**

The river's designation as "best clear stream in Kanto area" [🔗](https://www.tnap.jp/english/index.php) reflects ongoing conservation efforts to maintain exceptional water quality and wildlife habitat. This preservation work represents contemporary Japanese values of environmental stewardship (*kankyō hozen*) while honoring traditional respect for natural water sources.

## The Experience

**Salmon Migration Viewing (October-December):**

From October through December, natural chum salmon migrate up from the sea to spawn in the Nakagawa River's clear waters, offering visitors "lots of moving scenes" as wild salmon navigate upstream. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/40505) Viewing opportunities exist from riverbanks or during rafting and kayaking tours where participants may see salmon from their boats. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/47384)

The salmon's journey upstream represents one of nature's most dramatic life cycles, particularly moving when witnessed in the wild. The clear water quality allows excellent visibility of fish navigating the current. Early mornings during peak migration (October-November) offer best viewing conditions when lighting is optimal and fish are most active.
