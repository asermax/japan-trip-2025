Ura-Sabaku (裏砂漠) is Japan's only officially designated desert, located on the northeast side of Mt. Mihara on Izu Oshima Island. This extraordinary lunar-like landscape covers the volcanic slopes in a blanket of black scoria and volcanic ash, creating an otherworldly environment unique in Japan. The desert holds the distinction of being the only place marked as "desert" on maps prepared by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan.

November offers excellent conditions for desert exploration with mild temperatures (17°C daytime), lower humidity than summer months, and potential for clear views of Mt. Fuji from the volcanic landscape. The typhoon season concludes in November, providing more stable weather patterns for hiking. [🔗](https://weathermondo.com/japan/izu-oshima/)

## Cultural & Geological Significance

Ura-Sabaku is an extraordinary volcanic desert formed by the accumulation of fine lava, scoria, and volcanic ash from Mt. Mihara's repeated eruptions over centuries. The desert's formation is driven by Izu Oshima's persistent southwest winds, which carry volcanic material to the northeast side of the crater with each eruption, depositing thick layers of ash. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/geologicalsites/geosite-12.html)

Even during non-eruptive periods, strong winds and rainwater constantly reshape the surface, preventing plant seeds and shoots from establishing themselves, thus preserving the stark black desert landscape indefinitely. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/fuji-hakone-izu/see-and-do/volcanic-exploration-in-izu-oshima-geopark/)

The ground is covered in scoria—small, porous black volcanic rocks that create a granular "black sand" surface. Tephra layers (volcanic ash-based sediments) from individual eruptions spanning 100 to 150 years are stacked in the landscape, forming beautiful striped patterns visible in exposed areas around the desert.

### Geopark Status and Educational Value

Ura-Sabaku is a key geological site within the Izu Oshima Geopark, which has been certified as a Japan Geopark—part of a UNESCO-supported initiative for places where visitors can learn about the relationship between Earth and life. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/geologicalsites/geosite-12.html) The desert serves as an outdoor classroom for understanding volcanic processes, wind erosion, and the extreme conditions that prevent vegetation establishment.

The area is designated as a special protected area within Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, ensuring its preservation for future generations. This protection status reflects both its geological uniqueness and its cultural significance to Japan's natural heritage. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-pn0003132/)

## The Otherworldly Landscape Experience

Visitors consistently describe Ura-Sabaku as feeling "like being on the moon" or "stepping on extraterrestrial land." One visitor recounted initially thinking this comparison was marketing hyperbole, but upon arrival found "the landscape was black and there was almost no sound. It was so quiet and the color so unnatural that indeed seemed like stepping on extraterrestrial land." [🔗](https://belleelene.com/2020/12/04/attempting-oshima-2-a-weekend-in-izu-oshima/)

The desert is described as "as close to a moonscape that I can imagine" with "black volcanic sand really glistens in the sun and the water in the distance is a stark azure shade." [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1091144-d8541473-Reviews-Ura_Desert-Oshima_machi_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) The stark contrast between the lifeless black terrain and the vibrant blue ocean visible in the distance creates a surreal visual experience.

### Sensory Experience

**Sound:** The desert offers an almost complete absence of sound—an eerie silence broken only by the crunch of volcanic sand beneath your feet. When walking on Ura-Sabaku, "the ground crunches and squeaks beneath your feet, like walking across the surface of a distant moon." [🔗](https://global.shima.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/articles/outdoor-adventures-oshima-black-desert-island/)

**Visual:** The black scoria creates patterns and textures across the landscape, with exposed tephra layers showing beautiful striped patterns from successive volcanic eruptions. Volcanic gases occasionally drift across the terrain, adding to the otherworldly atmosphere. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/feature/izuoshima-tourist-spot/)

**Tactile:** The volcanic sand is notably slippery—visitors must be careful when walking uphill through the scoria. The granular lava shifts underfoot, creating a unique hiking experience unlike traditional mountain trails. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1091144-d8541473-Reviews-Ura_Desert-Oshima_machi_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

### Mt. Fuji Views

On clear days, Mt. Fuji is visible from the desert and Mt. Mihara summit, providing a spectacular backdrop to the volcanic landscape. [🔗](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/tokyo/mount-mihara-ohachi-meguri-course-the-summit-trail) November weather patterns often provide excellent visibility for this iconic view, especially during morning hours.
