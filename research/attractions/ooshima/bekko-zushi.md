*Bekko-zushi showing the characteristic amber "tortoiseshell" color from chili-soy marinade*

Bekko-zushi is Izu Oshima Island's signature culinary tradition—spicy sushi made with fresh white fish marinated in island green chili pepper soy sauce. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/) The name derives from the lustrous amber color that develops when fresh fish slices are marinated, resembling bekko (tortoiseshell) in Japanese. [🔗](http://tokyoislands.jp/bekko-local-unique-lustrous-amber-color-dish)

The spicy soy sauce of green chili peppers and the sweetness of fresh fish go perfectly together, with the sweetness of vinegared rice mixed with the zest of chili and umami from the fish creating a very tasty combination. [🔗](http://tokyoislands.jp/bekko-local-unique-lustrous-amber-color-dish) The dish is highly addictive, with taste differing depending on the shop as every establishment has its own distinct recipe. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The origin of bekko-zushi started on Izu Oshima before the Meiji Era, developed when wasabi wasn't easily accessible on the isolated island. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/) It represents a preservation technique invented by island predecessors to keep fish fresh in the warm Izu Islands climate without refrigeration—adding green chili pepper to soy sauce for its bactericidal effect. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/)

In Izu Oshima, locals developed a unique technique of eating sushi after the Meiji era by pairing soy sauce with strong spicy green pepper instead of using wasabi. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/) When eating sashimi on Oshima, the traditional method involves crushing green pepper then dipping it in soy sauce to transfer the spiciness—this technique was acquired as a replacement for wasabi. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/)

Every family and restaurant has their own distinct recipe passed down through generations, making each bekko-zushi experience unique to the establishment. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/)

### Ingredients & Preparation Tradition

**Fish Selection:** Mainly white fish such as sea bream, tuna, bonito, butterfish, and parrotfish (budai) are used. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/) Parrotfish is particularly prized—it has a humorous appearance and eats mainly seaweed, making its meat less odorous than most, with mild flavor and gentle springiness, best eaten in winter. [🔗](https://sushiuniversity.jp/basicknowledge/japanese-parrotfish-budai)

**Island Chili Peppers:** The key ingredient is shima tou-garashi (island chili pepper), which is thicker, shorter, and more spicy than regular chili pepper. [🔗](http://tokyoislands.jp/bekko-local-unique-lustrous-amber-color-dish) These island green chilies are grown locally, with some restaurants like Zakoya Kiyomaru using chilies from their own gardens. [🔗](https://tamashima.tokyo/en/collaborate/article005-1.html)

**Marinating Process:** Slices of white sashimi fish are marinated in chili soy sauce for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, though timing varies by family and shop traditions. [🔗](https://www.foodinjapan.org/kanto/bekko-sushi/) The marinade typically includes soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, salt, and the region's special green chili pepper.
