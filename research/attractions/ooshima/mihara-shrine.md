Mihara Shrine (三原神社, Mihara Jinja) is a sacred Shinto shrine located at the summit of Mt. Mihara on Izu Oshima Island, approximately 100 kilometers south of Tokyo. The shrine honors "Gojinka-sama" (御神火様 - Lord Sacred Fire), the volcanic deity representing the divine fire and spiritual power of the island's active volcano. Originally worshipped as "Mihara Daimyojin," the chief guardian god of Oshima, the shrine embodies the island's profound tradition of volcanic worship dating back to the Jomon period. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-1.html)

Since ancient times, Mount Mihara has been called "Gojinka" (divine fire), with island residents believing that gods dwell in the volcanic flames. The phenomenon of volcanic smoke and the bright red glow reflecting off clouds above the crater were viewed as sacred manifestations of the deity's presence. [🔗](https://oshima-navi.com/shrine/shrine001.html)

Most remarkably, during the catastrophic 1986 eruption—when all 10,200 residents and 2,000 tourists were evacuated as lava fountains reached 1.6 kilometers high—Mihara Shrine survived untouched. A ridge of hardened lava from the 1951 eruption split the approaching lava flow, diverting it around both sides of the shrine building before merging further down the slope. [🔗](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/11370/) This miraculous survival is counted among Oshima's seven wonders and reinforces local believers' faith in the protective power of Gojinka-sama. [🔗](https://oshima-navi.com/shrine/shrine001.html)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

**Gojinka Volcanic Deity Worship:**

The term "Gojinka" (御神火) combines the honorific "御" (go/o), "神" (shin/kami - god/deity), and "火" (ka/hi - fire), translating as "Sacred Fire," "Divine Fire," or "Lord Fire." [🔗](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/11370/) This honorific prefix elevates volcanic fire beyond mere natural phenomenon to a revered spiritual force central to island identity.

The cultural concept of "Gojinka" permeates island life, transforming volcanic power into romantic and spiritual symbols maintained through generations. A famous local folk love song contains the line: "I was raised by Oshima's sacred fire, smoke forever rising in my heart." [🔗](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/11370/) This deep cultural connection makes Mihara Shrine not merely a tourist attraction but a living embodiment of how communities adapt to and revere powerful natural forces.

Mt. Mihara has been revered by residents for thousands of years as a sacred site dating back to the Jomon period. The volcano was enshrined as Mihara Daimyojin (Mihara Grand Deity), the chief guardian god of Oshima. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-1.html) Long ago, exploding magma would create a red sky that the islanders called "Gojinka," which the people revered as a manifestation of divine power. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/park/coexistence.html) This spiritual tradition persisted through the 1986 eruption, with Mihara Shrine playing a symbolic role in the island's resilience narrative.

**Historical Evolution:**

The shrine's history reflects the ongoing relationship between islanders and their volcano. Originally, only a torii gate stood at the mountain's base to honor Mihara Daimyojin as the island's chief guardian deity. During the Taisho period, a concrete shrine building was constructed mid-mountain with a small shrine at the summit. However, the 1950-51 eruption buried this structure in lava, leading to its reconstruction at the current summit location. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-1.html)

**The Miracle of 1986:**

Mihara Shrine's survival during the 1986 eruption became a powerful symbol of hope and divine protection for island residents. The shrine miraculously survived when a ridge of hardened lava just above the building split the approaching lava flow, diverting it around the shrine structure. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-1.html) This "miracle" reinforced spiritual interpretations of the volcano and strengthened cultural narratives about coexistence with volcanic forces.

**Annual Ceremonies & Broader Gojinka Worship:**

Mihara Shrine hosts an annual mountain pilgrimage ceremony (Oyama-mairi/mountain opening) every June 1st—the traditional start of the climbing season when local residents honor Gojinka-sama. [🔗](https://oshima-navi.com/shrine/shrine001.html) While not relevant to November visits, this ceremony demonstrates the shrine's continuing role in island spiritual life.

Beyond the summit shrine, Yoshiya Shrine in Yoshiya village serves as the primary year-round worship site for Mihara Grand Myojin (the chief god of the whole island). The "New Year Festival at Yoshiya Shrine" is a festival with a long history, designated as Tokyo Metropolitan Government Intangible Folk Cultural Property in 1958, where people dedicate "Mikomai dance" (shrine maiden dance) and hand dance to pray for the calming of eruptions and the repose of the souls of victims. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-10.html) This festival demonstrates how Gojinka worship extends beyond the summit shrine to encompass the entire island's spiritual practices.

## The Shrine Experience

**The Vermillion Torii Gate:**

The vermillion torii gate at the inner rim summit serves as the photographic highlight, especially on clear days when Mt. Fuji appears perfectly framed through its structure. This composition captures the spiritual connection between two sacred volcanic peaks. [🔗](https://sima-life.com/mount-mihara2/) On clear November days (57% Mt. Fuji visibility likelihood), visitors can photograph Mt. Fuji perfectly framed through the torii gate—a composition representing the intersection of Japan's two most sacred volcanic peaks. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/mt-fuji-weather-guide-2025-seasonal-climate-insights-best-viewing-times-and-climbing-conditions/)

**The Shrine Building:**

From the torii gate, descend along the mountain path to reach the shrine building itself—the structure that miraculously survived the 1986 lava flows. The shrine's survival story is physically evident in the surrounding hardened lava formations that diverted the flow. [🔗](https://izuoshima-geo.org/en/highlights/culturalsites/cultural-1.html)

**Crater Rim Walk (Ohachi-meguri):**

The 20-minute circuit around the crater rim offers breathtaking views of the active volcanic crater, the Pacific Ocean, Mt. Fuji (weather permitting), and the Izu Peninsula. The contrast between pristine blue waters and desolate volcanic terrain creates dramatic photo opportunities. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1724/)

**Volcanic Landscape:**

Experience the raw power of Gojinka-sama through the surrounding volcanic terrain—hardened lava fields, steaming vents, and the massive crater that produced the 1986 eruption. The landscape provides visceral context for understanding why islanders revere this volcano as a sacred deity. [🔗](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/11370/)
