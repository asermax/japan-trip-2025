Tokyo Metropolitan Oshima Park is a multifaceted natural park established in 1938 on Izu Oshima Island, located approximately 120 kilometers from Tokyo in the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. [ðŸ”—](https://www.kankyo1.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/naturepark/english/know/shisetsu/fureai/ooshima.html) The park encompasses 3.27 square kilometers divided into two main areas: the Oshima Park area (featuring a zoo, camellia garden, and museum) and the Goze River area (Umi no Furusato Mura) for extended stays. [ðŸ”—](https://internationalcamellia.org/en-us/asia-gardens-of-excellence/camellia-garden-of-tokyo-metropolitan-oshima-park)

The park was designated as an International Camellia Garden of Excellence in 2016 by the International Camellia Society, housing one of Japan's largest camellia collections with approximately 3,200 cultivated trees representing around 1,000 species and cultivars, plus 5,000 wild Camellia japonica trees.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Comprehensive Park History and Cultural Context

Tokyo Metropolitan Oshima Park was established in 1938 during the pre-war Showa period, with its camellia collection beginning around 1940. [ðŸ”—](https://internationalcamellia.org/en-us/asia-gardens-of-excellence/camellia-garden-of-tokyo-metropolitan-oshima-park) The park leverages Oshima Island's unique natural environment, including volcanic landscapes, coastlines, and evergreen forests shaped by centuries of camellia cultivation heritage. [ðŸ”—](https://www.kankyo1.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/naturepark/english/know/shisetsu/fureai/ooshima.html)

The park's cultural significance extends far beyond ornamental gardens. Izu Oshima Island is home to approximately three million camellia trees that have sustained island communities for generations through camellia oil production, windbreak forestry for crop protection, and traditional cultural practices. [ðŸ”—](https://tamashima.tokyo/foreign/collaborate/article013-3.html) The camellia oil industry, epitomized by the famous Oshima Tsubaki brand founded in 1927 by Shunichi Okada, represents a profound connection between islanders and their natural environmentâ€”it takes 20-30 years before camellia plants produce harvestable seeds, and one tablespoon of oil requires 45 camellia seeds extracted through time-honored pressed expression methods. [ðŸ”—](https://ost.oshimatsubaki.co.jp/en/concept/)

In 1989, the park enhanced its educational mission by opening the Camellia Pavilion with a dedicated Camellia Museum, providing comprehensive information on camellia cultivation, industrial use, traditional Japanese cultural significance, and scientific knowledge. [ðŸ”—](https://internationalcamellia.org/en-us/asia-gardens-of-excellence/camellia-garden-of-tokyo-metropolitan-oshima-park) The 2016 International Camellia Garden of Excellence designation recognizes the park's role in camellia conservation, education, and cultural preservation.

### The Collection: World-Class Camellia Diversity

The camellia garden houses approximately 3,200 cultivated specimens representing around 1,000 species and cultivars, complemented by about 5,000 wild Camellia japonica (yabu-tsubaki) trees throughout the surrounding forests. [ðŸ”—](https://internationalcamellia.org/en-us/asia-gardens-of-excellence/camellia-garden-of-tokyo-metropolitan-oshima-park) This collection ranks among Japan's largest and most diverse camellia gardens.

The garden is thoughtfully organized into 9 specialized zones: [ðŸ”—](https://www.camellias.pics/visite-oshima-metropolitan-gb.php)

- **Foreign Cultivars Zone:** Western cultivars from Europe and America
- **Color-Sorted Zones:** Dedicated areas for red, white, yellow (rare kinkacha), purple, black, and pink varieties
- **Exhibition Greenhouse:** Open during Camellia Festival (late January-late March), featuring fragrant camellias, foreign species, and European cultivars
- **Cultural Heritage Zones:** Displaying traditional Japanese varieties and tea ceremony camellias
- **Wild Yabu-tsubaki Zones:** Native Oshima Island camellias demonstrating natural diversity

Among the vast collection, two symbolic cultivars welcome visitors at the entrance during the Camellia Festival: 'Akashigata' and 'Oniji', both known for their large, spectacular flowers. [ðŸ”—](https://www.camellias.pics/visite-oshima-metropolitan-gb.php)
