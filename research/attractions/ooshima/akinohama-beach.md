Akinohama Beach (秋の浜, Aki-no-hama) is Izu Oshima's premier diving destination and most famous beach-entry dive site. Located on the volcanic island 120km south of Tokyo, it stands out as a comprehensive underwater experience offering diverse marine environments from shallow boulder fields to deep walls. [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/tokyo/tokyo-izu-oshima) The site's comprehensive facilities, easy beach entry system with installed ladders, and exceptional marine biodiversity make it accessible to divers of all skill levels while maintaining appeal for experienced underwater photographers. [🔗](https://blog.padi.com/diving-in-tokyo-izu-islands/)

Akinohama represents the pinnacle of Izu Oshima's 100% beach-entry diving culture, offering a rare combination of accessibility and underwater diversity that rivals or even surpasses many boat-access sites in quality. [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo) The site's volcanic origin creates a maze-like underwater landscape of lava formations colonized by soft corals and sea fans, earning it the designation as part of an "Underwater Geopark."

## Cultural & Geological Significance

As the most popular of Izu Oshima's six beach diving spots, Akinohama enjoys strong support from repeat visitors who appreciate its versatile terrain. [🔗](https://marinediving.com/area/izu_islands/Izu_oshima/akinohama/) The beach offers everything a diver could ask for: boulder fields, sandy bottoms, slopes, walls, and deep areas, all accessible through a convenient ladder entry system. [🔗](https://blog.padi.com/diving-in-tokyo-izu-islands/) A jetty made of rocks and concrete advances into the sea, providing two easy entry points where divers can jump from either side, with two ladders available for comfortable exits. [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)

The site's location on a volcanic island surrounded by black sand beaches creates unique underwater topography. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Oshima) The Kuroshio Current from the south hits the island directly, providing consistently high water temperatures, excellent visibility year-round, and a rich variety of marine life. [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)

What distinguishes Akinohama from typical boat dives is the extended underwater time permitted by beach diving—often 40 to 50 minutes per dive without the time constraints of boat schedules. [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo) Divers can explore at a relaxed pace without battling strong currents, making the site particularly suitable for macro photography and detailed observation of marine life.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### November-Specific Considerations

**Thermal Protection Mandatory:**
November falls squarely in drysuit season (November-April) for Izu area diving. [🔗](https://bluejapan.org/diving/seasons/) Water temperatures of 50-60°F (11-17°C) make drysuit use essential for comfort and safety. While 7mm wetsuits are technically possible, surface temperatures in high 30s-low 40s°F (3-8°C) make surface intervals extremely uncomfortable without dry thermal protection. [🔗](https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/diving-in-japan)

**Water Temperature:** 50-60°F (11-17°C), requiring drysuit for comfort [🔗](https://bluejapan.org/diving/seasons/)

**Visibility:** Excellent year-round due to Kuroshio Current [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)

**Marine Life Highlights:**

- Surface temperatures high 30s-low 40s°F (3-8°C) [🔗](https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/diving-in-japan)
- Drysuit essential for thermal comfort in and out of water [🔗](https://bluejapan.org/diving/seasons/)

**Crowds:** Less crowded than summer swimming season; primarily serious divers

### Best Diving Strategies

**Maximize Thresher Shark Encounters:**
- Schedule dives on overcast, cloudy days when sharks are more active [🔗](https://tokyoislands.jp/post/traveling_tips/tokyo-oshima-island-scuba-diving)
- October and November offer peak encounter windows [🔗](https://tokyoislands.jp/post/traveling_tips/tokyo-oshima-island-scuba-diving)

**Optimize Dive Time:**
- Take advantage of beach diving's extended 40-50 minute bottom times [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)
- No boat schedule constraints allow relaxed exploration
- Explore varied depths from shallow to deep within single dive

**Equipment Considerations:**
- Book drysuit rental in advance for November diving [🔗](https://bluejapan.org/diving/seasons/)
- Bring or rent macro photography equipment to capture nudibranchs [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/tokyo/tokyo-izu-oshima)
- Ensure thermal underlayers for drysuit comfort in cool surface conditions

### Money-Saving Options

- Compare diving center packages—some include equipment, others charge separately
- Snorkeling offers lower-cost introduction (¥11,500 vs. full diving) [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/feature/izuoshima_diving/)
- Multi-dive packages often provide better value than single dives
- Ferry from Atami (45 minutes) may be more economical than longer routes [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)

### Local Etiquette

- Respect the two-ladder entry/exit system—don't crowd exit points [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)
- Maintain buoyancy control to protect soft corals and lava formations [🔗](https://www.saiyu.co.jp/en/blog/wildlife_japan/2022/07/16/the-sea-of-izu-oshima-the-underwater-geopark-（２）/)
- Use provided facilities (showers, toilets) to maintain beach cleanliness
- Book diving services in advance, especially for equipment rental

### Photography Recommendations

- Bring macro lens setup—nudibranchs present on every dive [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/tokyo/tokyo-izu-oshima)
- Wide-angle for volcanic topography and lava formations [🔗](https://www.saiyu.co.jp/en/blog/wildlife_japan/2022/07/16/the-sea-of-izu-oshima-the-underwater-geopark-（２）/)
- Utilize extended 40-50 minute dives for multiple photo opportunities [🔗](https://dive-in-japan.com/destinations/tokyo)

### Safety Precautions

**Weather-Dependent Ferry Service:**
Winter weather conditions may affect ferry reliability. Confirm service and have backup dates if possible, especially if traveling from Tokyo as a day trip.

**Shark Encounter Expectations:**
While November offers peak thresher shark season, the 50% encounter rate on overcast days means success is not guaranteed. [🔗](https://tokyoislands.jp/post/traveling_tips/tokyo-oshima-island-scuba-diving) Plan dives with appreciation for the exceptional macro life and volcanic topography as primary attractions, treating shark encounters as bonus experiences.

**Beginner Limitations:**
Despite beginner-friendly infrastructure, November's drysuit requirement may present challenges for inexperienced divers unfamiliar with drysuit operation. First-time divers should consider guided experience diving with one-on-one instruction. [🔗](https://en.activityjapan.com/publish/plan/35174)

**Equipment Rental Availability:**
Pre-book drysuit rentals, as demand may be higher in shark season and availability more limited than summer wetsuit season. Contact diving centers directly for current equipment rental pricing and availability.
