Aokigahara Forest, known as "Jukai" (樹海 - Sea of Trees), is a 30-square-kilometer dense primeval forest of mixed coniferous and broadleaf trees located at the northwestern base of Mount Fuji. The forest was formed in 864 CE when Mount Fuji's Jōgan eruption created the lava fields that became the foundation for this unique ecosystem. [🔗](https://fujisan.ne.jp/en/pages/215/)

The forest holds profound cultural and spiritual significance in Japanese tradition, historically considered a liminal space between the living and the dead. During the Heian to Edo periods, Buddhist ascetics imbued the forest with spiritual meaning, with some monks practicing extreme forms of asceticism including sokushinbutsu (self-mummification) in this sacred space.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The unique geological foundation of porous volcanic rock creates remarkable acoustic properties - the lava absorbs sound, contributing to a profound sense of solitude. Local folklore speaks of yūrei (ghosts) inhabiting the dense woods, and the forest is traditionally viewed as a pathway to Yomi (the underworld).

The cool, humid environment provides ideal conditions for bryophytes like mosses and lichen, creating an exceptionally green landscape where deer, foxes, wild rabbits, and diverse bird species thrive. The forest serves as a living testament to the spiritual connection between Japanese culture and the natural world.
