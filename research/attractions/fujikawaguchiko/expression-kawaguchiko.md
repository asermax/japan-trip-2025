Expression Kawaguchiko represents a revolutionary concept in Japanese dining, operated by FSX Corporation as their first direct B2C venture. The establishment embodies the company's expertise in disposable towels with various aromas (citral, peppermint, lavender) to create a multi-sensory dining experience that bridges French culinary artistry with traditional Japanese hospitality culture.

The cafe serves as the flagship location for FSX's "Expression Base and Co-Creation Project," where guests can enjoy the collaboration between oshibori (Japanese hand towels) - a symbol of Japanese hospitality culture - and exceptional cuisine. Each course is paired with specifically scented towels that complement the time of day and food flavors, creating what the establishment calls "a wonderful harmony between enchanting flavors and aromatic experiences."

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Optimal Experience Strategy:** Reserve terrace seating in advance during October for optimal weather and Mt. Fuji visibility. Request lavender towel pairing for the signature dessert experience. Visit during afternoon service (14:00-17:00) for best terrace lighting and clearest mountain views. Allow extra time to fully appreciate the multi-sensory aromatherapy dining concept.
