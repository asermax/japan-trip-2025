*Panoramic view from Sankodai showing Mount Fuji and the three lakes*

Sankodai Viewpoint, whose name literally means "three-lake viewpoint" in Japanese, is a elevated observation point located at 1,202 meters (3,943 feet) along the famous Tokai Nature Trail. The viewpoint derives its cultural significance from its exceptional panoramic views of Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage Site revered as a "Sacred Place and Source of Artistic Inspiration" for centuries. From this vantage point, visitors can simultaneously view three of the historic Fuji Five Lakes: Lake Saiko, Lake Shojiko, and Lake Motosuko - lakes that were once a single large body of water called "Lake Kosenoumi" before being divided by Mount Fuji's volcanic eruptions.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The viewpoint offers a spacious resting area with picnic tables and informational signboards, making it both an educational and contemplative destination. The site represents a perfect synthesis of Japan's natural beauty and spiritual heritage, where visitors can experience the same inspiring views that have captivated artists, pilgrims, and nature lovers for generations. Visitors can enjoy educational signboards explaining the geological history of how volcanic eruptions divided the original Lake Kosenoumi into the three separate lakes visible today.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Photography and Viewing:** Early morning (sunrise) offers the clearest Mount Fuji views and best lighting; bring telephoto lens for detailed Mount Fuji shots and wide-angle for panoramic views; the 150 yen fee at Koyodai Rest House cafe is worthwhile for unobstructed Fuji views
**Hiking Preparation:** Wear sturdy hiking shoes with good grip, especially important in autumn when trails can be slippery; bring warm layers due to elevation and autumn temperatures; pack water and snacks - no facilities at Sankodai itself; consider hiking poles for stability on muddy sections
**Cultural Etiquette:** Stay on designated trails to preserve the natural environment; carry out all trash - no waste facilities available; keep noise to minimum to respect the tranquil setting; don't disturb wildlife or remove natural materials; be courteous to other hikers on narrow trail sections
**Weather Dependency:** Views are completely weather-dependent - check Mount Fuji visibility forecasts before visiting. The mountain is often obscured by clouds, especially in afternoon
**Trail Safety:** While considered an easy family hike, trail can become slippery when wet. Mud and loose rocks require caution, particularly in autumn conditions
