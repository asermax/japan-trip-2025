AIM Brew LAB is a craft brewery that opened on June 29, 2024, making it one of the newest additions to the Fujikawaguchiko craft beverage scene.

The brewery occupies a renovated old farmhouse (kominka) near the parking area for Mt. Kenashi and Junigatake climbers. Despite its modern exterior appearance, the interior preserves traditional Japanese architectural elements including impressive wooden pillars, beams, and transoms that create an antique atmosphere. Large windows in the taproom provide views of the brewing equipment lined up in the brewery area. [ðŸ”—](https://fujikawaguchiko.fun/eat/aimbrewlab)
