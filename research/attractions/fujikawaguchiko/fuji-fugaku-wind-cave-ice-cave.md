The Fugaku Wind Cave and Narusawa Ice Cave represent two of Japan's most significant lava tube formations, created during Mount Fuji's devastating 864 A.D. eruption. These interconnected cave systems showcase extraordinary geological features where ancient lava flows created permanent natural refrigeration chambers that maintain near-freezing temperatures year-round.

Fugaku Wind Cave is 201 meters long and 8.7 meters high, featuring distinctive "goblin gold" luminescent moss that creates an otherworldly greenish-gold glow on the basalt walls. Narusawa Ice Cave is a more intimate 153-meter circular cave system that descends 21 meters underground, renowned for its spectacular ice pillars reaching up to 3 meters in height.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Both caves served crucial economic functions during Japan's Edo to early Showa periods (1603-1955), functioning as natural refrigerators for storing silkworm eggs and cocoons during the height of Japan's sericulture industry. Merchants would bring precious silk commodities from across the region to preserve them in these consistent 3Â°C environments. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mtfuji-cave.com/en/)

The caves were recognized as Natural Monuments of Japan in 1929, acknowledging their geological importance and cultural significance. They represent some of the most accessible lava tube systems in the world, offering visitors a unique glimpse into volcanic processes and traditional Japanese industrial practices.

## Visiting Information

**Hours:** Vary by season; typically 9:00-17:30 (last admission 15 minutes before closing) [ðŸ”—](https://www.mtfuji-cave.com/en/)

**Admission:** Adult Â¥350 per cave, Child Â¥200 per cave; Combined ticket Â¥600 (saves Â¥100); Group rates: Adults Â¥250, Children Â¥100 (15+ people) [ðŸ”—](https://www.mtfuji-cave.com/en/)

**Transportation:** From Kawaguchiko Station: Green Line Sightseeing Bus to Fugaku-Fuketsu stop (50 minutes) or Blue Line Sightseeing Bus to Narusawa Hyoketsu stop (30 minutes). Regular buses toward Lake Motosuko depart every 1-2 hours. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mtfuji-cave.com/en/access/)

**Physical Requirements:** Ice Cave requires crouching through 90cm-high sections and navigating steep stairs. Not suitable for visitors with mobility limitations or heart conditions due to temperature extremes.

## The Experience

**Fugaku Wind Cave Experience:** Visitors descend gently through this lateral lava tube, encountering illuminated ice formations that persist even in summer heat. The cave showcases distinctive lava shelves and rope-like lava formations alongside towering ice pillars. The luminescent moss creates an ethereal atmosphere, while the natural acoustics create an unusually quiet environment where sound is absorbed by porous volcanic walls.

**Narusawa Ice Cave Experience:** This challenging pit-type cave requires physical agility as visitors navigate steep stairs and crouch through narrow sections. The reward is spectacular ice pillar formations reaching up to 3 meters high, creating a natural ice palace deep underground. The circular route provides multiple viewing angles of these frozen sculptures. [ðŸ”—](https://www.yamanashi-kankou.jp/english/recover/narusawa-ice-cave.html)

**October Conditions:** Outside temperatures of 15-20Â°C provide comfortable contrast to cave interiors. Ice formations remain substantial from winter buildup, and autumn foliage in surrounding Aokigahara Forest enhances the approach experience.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Strategic Visiting:** Purchase combined ticket for both caves to save Â¥100. Visit Ice Cave first for the more challenging experience when energy is high. Allow minimum 90 minutes total including walking time between caves. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mtfuji-cave.com/en/attention/)

**Safety Considerations:** Heart patients and elderly visitors advised against entry due to temperature extremes. Proper footwear essential for wet basalt surfaces. Temperature shock from 20Â°C+ outside air to 3Â°C cave environment requires preparation.

**Physical Preparation:** Ice Cave requires good mobility and flexibility for low ceiling sections. Avoid large backpacks or bags as they hinder movement through narrow sections. Essential to bring warm layers regardless of outside temperature.

**Cultural Etiquette:** Respect the geological formations with no touching of ice or rock features. Photography allowed but avoid flash in sensitive areas. Follow designated pathways to preserve delicate formations.
