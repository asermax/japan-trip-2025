Momijidai Rest House (also known as Koyodai/Á¥ÖËëâÂè∞Â±ïÊúõ„É¨„Çπ„Éà„Éè„Ç¶„Çπ) is an observation deck and rest facility located in Narusawa Village, Yamanashi Prefecture, at an elevation of 1,164-1,167.8 meters. The name "Momijidai" translates to "Maple Platform," reflecting its reputation as one of the premier autumn foliage viewing locations in the Mount Fuji region. The facility features a distinctive two-story rest house with an observation deck on the second floor that provides 360-degree panoramic views of Mount Fuji, the Aokigahara Jukai forest, Lake Motosu, Lake Saiko, and the Southern Alps.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The site is integrated into the Tokai Nature Trail system, a long-distance hiking route that spans multiple prefectures. As autumn deepens, the surrounding forest transforms into what visitors describe as "a colorful painting," with red and yellow deciduous trees mixing with green conifers to create spectacular natural displays that frame Mount Fuji. The location is strategically positioned to offer unobstructed views to the south of Mount Fuji rising directly above the famous Aokigahara "Sea of Trees" forest, while providing views of multiple Fuji Five Lakes to the north and west.

## The Trail Experience

From the observation deck, visitors experience a 360-degree panoramic vista that includes the most dramatic southern perspective featuring Mount Fuji rising directly in front with the vast Aokigahara Jukai forest spreading at its base. During autumn, this view becomes particularly spectacular as the forest canopy displays vibrant fall colors. Northern and western views provide clear sightlines to Lake Saiko and Lake Motosu, two of the famous Fuji Five Lakes, often reflecting the surrounding autumn foliage. The location serves as a waypoint on the Tokai Nature Trail, allowing visitors to continue hiking to Sankodai (approximately 20 minutes uphill) for additional viewing perspectives where all three lakes (Saiko, Motosu, and Shojiko) can be seen simultaneously.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Photography Strategy:** Position yourself with your back to Lake Saiko to capture both Mount Fuji and autumn leaves in the same frame; best lighting occurs during morning and late afternoon hours; the 360-degree access allows for varied composition opportunities throughout the day
**Hiking Preparation:** Wear appropriate hiking footwear for the 30-minute uphill trail; bring layers as elevation creates cooler temperatures than lake level; trail is part of the challenging Tokai Nature Trail system but this section is considered moderate difficulty
**Cultural Considerations:** Respect the natural environment as part of Mount Fuji's UNESCO World Heritage designation; follow Leave No Trace principles on the trail; be mindful of other hikers on the shared Tokai Nature Trail
**Optimal Timing:** Early morning visits offer clearest Mount Fuji views before afternoon clouds develop; allow 2-3 hours total including hiking time; consider combining with nearby Lake Motosu or Lake Saiko visits
**Trail Difficulty:** While described as moderate, the Tokai Nature Trail system is known for challenging terrain. The Momijidai section involves 30 minutes of uphill hiking
