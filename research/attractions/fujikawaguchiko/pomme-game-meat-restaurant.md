## Cultural & Religious Significance

POMME embodies the Japanese gibier cuisine revival, where wild game consumption serves both culinary and environmental purposes - addressing overpopulation of deer and wild boar that damage local crops while providing nutritious, high-protein, low-calorie dining options. The restaurant represents the evolution of centuries-old mountain survival cuisine that has evolved into sophisticated modern gastronomy while maintaining traditional respect for ingredients.
