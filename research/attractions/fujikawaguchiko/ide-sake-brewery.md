Ide Sake Brewery stands as the sole sake producer in the Fuji Five Lakes region, representing an unbroken 21-generation family tradition dating back to the mid-Edo period. Originally established as a soy sauce and miso brewery around 1700, the facility transitioned to sake production in 1850 when the 16th generation owner recognized the exceptional potential of Mt. Fuji's pure spring water.

Located at 850 meters above sea level, the brewery benefits from ideal brewing conditions: cool mountain climate and abundant spring water from Mt. Fuji at 1,100 meters elevation. These natural advantages, combined with traditional kan-zukuri (cold-weather brewing) methods, produce the brewery's signature Kai no Kaiun sake.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The brewery represents 21 generations of continuous family operation, demonstrating exceptional cultural continuity in traditional Japanese craftsmanship. The facility encompasses traditional Edo-period architecture, including the original family residence and a 300-year-old Japanese garden, providing authentic glimpses into historic Japanese brewery culture.

In 2020, the brewery expanded into whiskey production under the Daijukai brand, demonstrating how traditional methods adapt to modern craftsmanship while maintaining core cultural values. [ðŸ”—](https://visitgreatertokyoarea.org/yamanashi/spots/spot6/)

## October Seasonal Significance

October marks the beginning of traditional sake brewing season (kan-zukuri), making this timing ideal for witnessing preparation activities and understanding seasonal production cycles. The cooler autumn temperatures demonstrate why this elevation and climate are perfect for sake production.

October 2025 visit considerations:
- Autumn temperatures average 10-15Â°C (50-59Â°F) with potential for cool mornings
- The brewery's 850-meter elevation may feel cooler than lake level
- Traditional brewing season preparation provides unique insights into seasonal cycles
- Clear autumn air enhances Mt. Fuji viewing opportunities from the brewery [ðŸ”—](https://www.thesakecompany.com/blogs/sake-drops/natural-sake-brewing-in-seasonal-cycles)
