Lake Suwa Service Area (諏訪湖サービスエリア, Suwako SA) is a premium rest stop on the Chuo Expressway (E20) that has earned designation as both a Japan Night View Heritage site and a "Lover's Sanctuary" for its exceptional panoramic views. The service area is split between two municipalities and directions: the upbound (Tokyo-direction) facility in Suwa City and the downbound (Nagoya-direction) facility in Okaya City, with both offering stunning vistas of Lake Suwa from elevated positions.

The observation deck provides views over Lake Suwa, a body of water steeped in ancient Suwa Shinko (諏訪信仰) nature worship centered around the Suwa Grand Shrine (Suwa Taisha). For centuries, the lake has been revered as a deity and source of spiritual power. In recent years, the view gained international fame for resembling Lake Itomori from the anime film "Your Name" (君の名は。), adding modern pop culture significance to this historically sacred landscape.

The service area sits at approximately 800 meters elevation on a plateau south of Lake Suwa (759m), offering sweeping views of the Yatsugatake and Kirigamine mountain ranges beyond the lake. The downbound facility is positioned slightly higher than the upbound, though both provide excellent viewing opportunities.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Modern travelers stopping at the service area unknowingly participate in a tradition of pausing to acknowledge Lake Suwa's spiritual power. Historically, pilgrims visited Suwa Taisha's four shrine complexes positioned around the lake, believing the male and female deities traveled across the water to meet. The famous Omiwatari (御神渡り, "The God's Crossing") winter phenomenon - dramatic ice cracks from pressure ridges - was believed to be the male deity's footprints crossing to the female deity, used to divine harvest fortune.

The service area has become a pilgrimage site for fans of the anime "Your Name" due to striking resemblance to the film's Lake Itomori. This adds a layer of modern pop culture significance to the ancient sacred landscape, creating an interesting blend of traditional faith and contemporary fandom.
