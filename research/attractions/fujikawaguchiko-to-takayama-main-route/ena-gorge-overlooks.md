Ena Gorge (恵那峡, Enakyo) is a spectacular river valley carved by the Kiso River in southeastern Gifu Prefecture. The gorge was created during the Taisho Period (1912-1926) when entrepreneur Momosuke Fukuzawa commissioned the construction of the Oi Dam, transforming the flowing Kiso River into a scenic artificial lake surrounded by dramatic cliffs and mysteriously shaped rock formations. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ena_Gorge)

The gorge was named by geographer Shiga Shigetaka, who praised its "harmony of mysteriously shaped rocks." Today, it serves as one of the most accessible natural attractions near the Nagoya Metropolitan area, drawing visitors year-round for its distinctive seasonal beauty - cherry blossoms in spring, lush greenery in summer, and vibrant autumn foliage in fall. The gorge features several notable rock formations including Byobu Rock, Gunkan Rock, Shishi Rock, Kagami Rock, and the National Natural Monument Kasa Rock, made of black mica-granite shaped by weathering into umbrella-like formations.

Recent renovations in 2020 modernized the visitor facilities, adding the new Ena Gorge Visitor Center along with renovated Sazanami Plaza and Momosuke Plaza, making the gorge more accessible and informative for modern travelers. [🔗](https://visitgifu.com/see-do/ena-gorge/)

## Cultural & Natural Significance

Ena Gorge represents a unique fusion of natural beauty and early 20th-century engineering. The transformation from a flowing river to a scenic lake demonstrates Japan's historical approach to balancing industrial development with aesthetic values. Momosuke Fukuzawa, known as the "king of electric power," envisioned creating not just a functional dam but a scenic destination that would be celebrated for its beauty. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ena_Gorge)

The gorge's rock formations, particularly the National Natural Monument Kasa Rock, showcase the geological forces that shaped this region over millennia. The weathered granite formations create distinctive umbrella-like shapes that have become iconic symbols of the gorge. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ena_Gorge)
