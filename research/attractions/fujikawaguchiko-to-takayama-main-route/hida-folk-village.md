Hida Folk Village stands as Japan's most comprehensive outdoor museum preserving traditional mountain architecture and rural life from the Edo Period (1603-1868). Established in 1971, this 99,000 square meter cultural site houses over 30 meticulously relocated traditional buildings from throughout the Hida region, including famous gassho-zukuri farmhouses that inspired UNESCO World Heritage designation of nearby Shirakawa-go.

The village serves as a living museum where visitors experience authentic rural Japanese culture through preserved buildings, traditional craft demonstrations, and seasonal cultural events. The centerpiece gassho-zukuri structures, with steep thatched roofs resembling hands in prayer ("gassho"), represent centuries of architectural adaptation to harsh mountain winters and heavy snowfall.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Beyond architectural preservation, Hida Folk Village functions as an active cultural preservation center where master craftspeople demonstrate traditional skills including Hida lacquerwork, wood carving from local Ichii trees, straw crafts, sashiko quilting, and weaving techniques passed down through generations. The village maintains authentic seasonal rhythms, with indoor hearths lit each morning and traditional festivals celebrated throughout the year.

Four buildings designated as Important Cultural Assets showcase more gassho-zukuri architecture than found at Shirakawa-go itself. Notable structures include Wakayama's House, Nishioka's House, and the former village head's house, each displaying original daily life artifacts and period tools. Indoor sunken hearths (girori) are lit daily, demonstrating traditional heating methods essential for mountain survival. [ðŸ”—](https://visitgifu.com/see-do/hida-folk-village/)
