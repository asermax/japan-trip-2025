Matsumoto City Center represents the historical heart of Japan's second-largest city in Nagano Prefecture, serving as a gateway to the Northern Japanese Alps and preserving centuries of merchant heritage. The downtown area centers around two distinct historic shopping streets - Nakamachi Street and Nawate Street (Frog Street) - both located within a compact, walkable area just minutes from Matsumoto Castle.

**Nakamachi Street** - The Merchant District: Matsumoto's main historical merchant district where wholesale dealers - primarily sake brewers and kimono merchants - conducted business during the Edo period (1603-1867). The street is distinguished by remarkably preserved kura (traditional storehouses) with distinctive black-and-white criss-cross patterned walls, white-washed facades, and black-tiled roofs. After a devastating 1888 fire, these fire-resistant warehouse-style buildings were rebuilt to protect valuable merchant goods. [ðŸ”—](https://nakamachi.org/en/)

**Nawate Street** - Frog Street: This 200-meter-long pedestrian-only brick street, dating back to the 1500s, is known as "Frog Street" due to kajika frogs that once populated the area. The street's frog theme carries deeper cultural significance - "kaeru" (frog) in Japanese also means "to return home," symbolizing safe journeys for travelers. Features approximately 50 shops ranging from antique dealers and traditional dagashi (old-fashioned candy) stores to stylish bakeries and designer boutiques.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Matsumoto has long held political and commercial significance as the historical capital of Shinano (old name for Nagano area). The merchant town developed primarily during the era of the Mizuno clan (1642-1725), with merchant housing and shops emerging to the east and south of the castle. The preserved merchant district represents Matsumoto's evolution from a feudal castle town into a thriving commercial center.

**Route Context:** Matsumoto City Center marks the transition point on the Fujikawaguchiko â†’ Takayama journey, providing urban cultural immersion between mountain scenery segments. The city's historical role as gateway to the mountains and commercial hub shaped the merchant prosperity visible in the preserved kura architecture.
