Tateishi Park (立石公園, Tateishi Kōen) sits at 934 meters elevation on a hillside overlooking Lake Suwa in Nagano Prefecture, approximately 1.5 km northeast of Suwa city center. The park gained widespread recognition through multiple certifications including "Shinshu Sunset Point 100 Selection," "New Japan's Three Great Night Views," "Night View 100 Selection," and "Shinshu Hometown Viewpoint Hill."

The park's panoramic observation terrace, which can accommodate 300 people, offers sweeping views of Lake Suwa, Suwa City, Okaya City, and Shimosuwa Town. On clear days, the distant Northern Alps mountain range provides a dramatic backdrop, particularly spectacular during sunset when the sun sets behind the Japanese Alps.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Tateishi Park achieved international fame after the 2016 release of Makoto Shinkai's animated film "Your Name" (Kimi no na wa, 君の名は). The park's view of Lake Suwa from the hillside bore a striking resemblance to the fictional village of Itomori depicted in the film. Director Shinkai drew inspiration from his childhood in Nagano Prefecture, and Lake Suwa served as the real-world inspiration for the lake featured in the movie. Since the film's release, Tateishi Park has become a popular pilgrimage site for anime fans worldwide.

The park was developed through Suwa City municipal projects in 2000 and 2001, transforming the naturally scenic mountain slope into a public recreational facility. The location is also known as a habitat for Japan's national butterfly, the Great Purple Emperor (Ōmurasaki). The park is nicknamed "Sunset Park Tateishi" due to its reputation as a premier sunset viewing location.

Lake Suwa itself holds profound spiritual and historical significance, surrounded by the ancient Suwa Taisha shrine complex—one of Japan's oldest Shinto shrines, dating back to at least the 7th century. The area maintains ancient forms of nature worship and mountain reverence from Japan's prehistoric Jōmon culture (ca. 10,000-300 BCE).

## Visiting Information

**Route Context:** Detour level: Short Detour (15-30 minutes off main expressway route). Distance from main route: 30 minutes from Suwa IC. Works well as scenic break midway through Fujikawaguchiko to Takayama journey.

**Seasonal Considerations:** Late October - mid-to-late autumn foliage season. Park elevation (934m) likely past peak foliage, but lower elevation basin areas showcase autumn colors. Temperature range: 5-15°C. Potential morning frost. Clear autumn air provides exceptional Northern Alps visibility. Sunset approximately 5:00-5:30 PM.

**Parking:** Capacity: 25 spaces (including 2 disabled). Cost: Free. **CRITICAL**: Limited capacity fills quickly, especially weekends and sunset hours. City recommends checking live camera before visiting. Visitors report hour-long waits before sunset on weekends.

### Photography Opportunities

**Sunset Photography:** The park is renowned as one of Shinshu's top 100 sunset points. The sun setting behind the Japanese Alps creates dramatic silhouettes with Lake Suwa reflecting the golden light. Golden hour provides soft, warm lighting ideal for landscape photography.

**"Your Name" Recreation:** Fans of the anime can recreate iconic scenes from the film, capturing the wide panoramic view of Lake Suwa that inspired director Makoto Shinkai. The viewing platform's perspective matches key scenes from the movie.

**Night Photography:** The city lights reflected on Lake Suwa create stunning nightscapes, earning recognition as one of "New Japan's Three Great Night Views." However, pathways lack lighting, requiring flashlights or phone lights for safe navigation after dark.
