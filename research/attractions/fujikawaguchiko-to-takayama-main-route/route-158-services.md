National Route 158 is a 250.1 km national highway connecting Fukui and Matsumoto, with the Matsumoto-Takayama section serving as a critical mountain highway through the Northern Alps.

The route passes through Hirayu Onsen at 1,200m elevation and includes 19 tunnels between Takayama and Matsumoto, making rest stops crucial for safety and comfort.

## Route-Specific Considerations

### Fuel Services

Route 158 is a mountain national highway without dedicated highway gas stations. **Fuel planning is critical:**

**Fuel Strategy:**
- Fill up in Matsumoto before departing (last urban fuel services)
- Hirayu Onsen area may have limited fuel services in the settlement
- Refuel in Takayama upon arrival (major city with full services)
- Conservative approach: Fuel up at both ends of the journey

### Road Conditions & Driving

**October 24, 2025 Considerations:**
- Route 158 has never been closed due to snow even in winter, making October travel highly reliable
- October weather generally excellent with comfortable temperatures and clear mountain views
- **Autumn foliage peak** in late October brings significant traffic increases, especially weekends
- **Early morning driving** recommended to avoid tour bus crowds

**Road Characteristics:**
- 19 tunnels between Matsumoto and Takayama
- **Abo Tunnel:** 4,370m with 790 yen toll (mandatory for main route)
- Winding sections with narrow passages requiring careful navigation
- Elevation gain to 1,200m at Hirayu Onsen
- **"Van Gogh's palette-like autumn views"** throughout the route in late October

**Abo Tunnel Toll Road:**
- Cost: 790 yen one way
- Length: 5.6 km total route, mostly 4.4 km Abo Tunnel
- Reduced crossing from 5-8 hours (old Route 158 pass) to 5 minutes
- Year-round access replacing winter-closed old pass road

### Seasonal October Driving Experience

Route 158 in late October offers one of Japan's most spectacular autumn driving experiences with vibrant colors peaking mid-to-late October at route elevations. Crisp mountain air with comfortable daytime temperatures. Enhanced photography opportunities at each rest stop. Crowded conditions on Sundays and holidays - weekday travel preferable.

**Recommended Approach:**
- Early morning departure beats tour bus rush and enjoys better lighting
- Allow 2.5-3 hours with rest stops (versus 2-hour base drive time)
- Plan photography stops at roadside stations and tunnel exits
- Prepare for temperature changes - Matsumoto moderate, Hirayu cooler at 1,200m
- Bring layers: Sweater or jacket recommended for outdoor facilities
