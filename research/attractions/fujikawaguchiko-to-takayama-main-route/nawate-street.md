Nawate Street (Nawate-dori or ç¸„æ‰‹é€šã‚Š) is a charming 200-meter pedestrian shopping street in Matsumoto that has existed since the 1500s. The name "Nawate" comes from a combination of the words for rope (nawa) and riverbank (dote), as it was once a narrow spit of land running between the Metoba River and the southern moat of Matsumoto Castle.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**The Frog Theme and Cultural Significance**

The street's unique frog theme has a poignant history. In the past, many Kajika frogs populated the area along the Metoba River, their chorus echoing for the locals. However, in 1959, Typhoon 7 brought devastating rain to Matsumoto, causing the Metoba River to overflow. The flooding forced the frogs to leave for higher ground and cleaner water upstream. Despite river cleanup efforts, the frogs never returned. [ðŸ”—](https://visitmatsumoto.com/en/history/whats-with-all-the-frogs/)

In 1972, the community created "Kaeru Daimyoujin" (frog great shining deity), a mini frog shrine, to rejuvenate the old street and preserve the memory of the departed amphibians. The street was then coined "Kaeru Machi" ('Frog Street'). The frog became particularly meaningful because "kaeru," the Japanese word for "frog," can also mean "to return home," thus symbolizing a safe return home for locals and travelers.

Today, artificial frog statues adorn the street, with three stone frogs greeting visitors at the west entrance - two of them dressed in samurai gear and engaging in battle. A large fiberglass frog sculpture created by Tokyo University of Arts students marks the street's entrance. [ðŸ”—](https://visitmatsumoto.com/en/spot/nawate-street/)

**Historical Context**

In 1879, Yohashira Shrine was built on October 1st before the Emperor of Japan's visit to the city. The name "Yohashira" translates to "Shrine of Four Pillars," referring to the four gods - Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi, Kamimusubi, and Amaterasu - which are central figures in Japanese mythology. With the appearance of Yohashira Shrine, this rope of land became the de facto pathway for pilgrims. [ðŸ”—](https://welcome-matsumoto.com/spots/spots-to-visit/yohashira-shrine/)
