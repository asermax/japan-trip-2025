Daio Wasabi Farm stands as Japan's largest wasabi cultivation site, transforming the pristine spring waters flowing from the Northern Alps into a thriving agricultural and cultural destination. Established in 1915, this 15-hectare farm represents over a century of traditional wasabi cultivation expertise, producing 150 tons annually and contributing to Nagano Prefecture's position as Japan's largest wasabi producer.

International recognition came when acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa selected the farm as a filming location for his 1990 film "Dreams," specifically for the "Village of the Watermills" chapter. The three picturesque watermills constructed for the film along the Tade River remain standing today, creating one of the most photographed scenes in the region and drawing film enthusiasts from around the world.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The farm's cultural significance extends beyond agriculture. It houses the Daio Shrine, which enshrines Hachimen Daio, an ancient local hero and medieval folklore figure considered the farm's spiritual protector. Sacred caves and shrine structures dot the property, connecting visitors to the region's historical narratives and local legends. [ðŸ”—](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/daio-wasabi-farm)

The farm operates as a living educational resource, demonstrating the exacting requirements of wasabi cultivation. The meticulously maintained network of small streams provides each wasabi plant with constantly flowing, mineral-rich spring water - conditions essential for producing high-quality "sawa wasabi" (water wasabi). This agricultural method, refined over generations, showcases the harmonious relationship between mountain water resources and traditional farming practices in the Japanese Alps region.

## The Experience

### Walking Trails and Wasabi Fields

The farm provides a self-guided walking trail (approximately 40 minutes) winding through the expansive wasabi cultivation areas. Visitors can observe the sophisticated irrigation system where crystal-clear spring water flows continuously through carefully engineered channels, maintaining the precise temperature and mineral content required for premium wasabi growth.

### Kurosawa's Watermills

The three traditional watermills along the Tade River, constructed for Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams" (1989), remain the farm's most iconic photographic subject. These functioning water wheels turn gently in the clear mountain water, framed by seasonal vegetation and creating the pastoral scenes that captured the director's vision of traditional Japanese rural life.
