Enakyo Service Area (恵那峡サービスエリア) stands as one of the most significant rest stops along the Chuo Expressway, positioned at the cultural and geographic transition point between Nagano Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture. Opened on March 5, 1975, this service area has evolved from a simple rest stop into a comprehensive facility showcasing regional culture, cuisine, and natural beauty. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/恵那峡サービスエリア)

The service area takes its name from nearby Ena Gorge, an artificial lake created in 1924 by the Oi Dam on the Kiso River. Named by geographer Shiga Shigetaka in 1920 for its "harmony of mysteriously shaped rocks," the gorge features distinctive geological formations including Byobu Rock, Gunkan Rock, Shishi Rock, and Kagami Rock—formations visible from various vantage points including the service area's observation deck.

What distinguishes Enakyo SA from typical highway rest stops is its emphasis on regional identity and premium offerings. The downbound facility underwent major renovation in August 2014, transforming it into a showcase for Gifu Prefecture's culinary heritage and natural beauty. Its location at the border region allows it to offer specialties from both Nagano (Shinshu soba, miso) and Gifu (Hida beef, chestnuts), creating a unique culinary crossroads.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The nearby Ena Gorge holds cultural significance as a named scenic area featuring rock formations designated as National Natural Monuments.
