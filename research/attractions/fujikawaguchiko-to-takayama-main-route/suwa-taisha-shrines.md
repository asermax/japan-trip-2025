## Basic Information

*Kamisha Honmiya main worship hall surrounded by sacred forest - the largest of the four Suwa Taisha shrines*

Suwa Taisha is not a single shrine but a sacred complex comprising four distinct Shinto shrines scattered across the Suwa region in Nagano Prefecture. The complex is counted among the oldest shrines in Japan, directly cited in the 8th-century Kojiki (Record of Ancient Matters), Japan's oldest surviving historical chronicle. A Muromachi-period document records that Suwa Taisha had been conducting renewal construction during the years of the Tiger and Monkey as far back as the early Heian period, establishing a tradition spanning over 1,200 years.

The shrine complex is divided into two groups:

**Kamisha (Upper Shrines)** - Southern shore of Lake Suwa:
- **Kamisha Honmiya:** Largest shrine with most historical buildings and Important Cultural Properties. Located at northern foothills of Mount Moriya, surrounded by virgin forest.
- **Kamisha Maemiya:** "Former shrine" located about 30 minutes walk from Honmiya.

**Shimosha (Lower Shrines)** - Northern shore of Lake Suwa:
- **Shimosha Harumiya:** "Spring shrine," worshiping a mighty Japanese cedar as its sacred object.
- **Shimosha Akimiya:** "Autumn shrine," featuring a magnificent Japanese yew tree as its sacred object.

What makes Suwa Taisha truly unique is its preservation of ancient nature worship predating formalized Shinto. Three of the four main sites lack the traditional honden (main sanctuary building). Instead, they worship natural elements directly: at Kamisha Honmiya, worshippers face Mount Moriya itself as the sacred body of the deity; at the Shimosha shrines, ancient trees serve as the physical manifestations of the kami. This represents forms of mountain and tree worship dating back thousands of years.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The shrine complex is famous for the Onbashira Festival, held every six years in the years of the Monkey and Tiger. During this dramatic event, sixteen giant fir trees (each over 17 meters tall and weighing 12 tons) are felled in the deep forest and transported by manpower alone to the four shrines, where they are erected as sacred pillars at the corners of each shrine compound. Festival participants ride the massive logs as they slide down mountainsides, making it one of Japan's most thrilling and dangerous festivals. The next Onbashira is scheduled for April 2028.

The area around Lake Suwa maintains ancient forms of nature worship and mountain reverence from Japan's prehistoric Jōmon culture (ca. 10,000-300 BCE), which was particularly vibrant in the Yatsugatake mountain foothills overlooking Lake Suwa some 5,000 years ago. Suwa Taisha preserves these ancient traditions, making it a living connection to Japan's pre-Buddhist spiritual heritage.

## The Experience

### Kamisha Honmiya (Main Upper Shrine) - Recommended for Route Travelers

**Key Structures:**

**Shikyakumon Gate (重要文化財):** The oldest structure at Honmiya, this "Four-footed Gate" was donated by Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1608 and is designated as an Important Cultural Property.

**Hōden (Treasure Halls):** Twin treasure halls preserving sacred objects and festival artifacts. The eastern and western buildings store ritual items used in ancient ceremonies.

**Sacred Mountain Worship:** The shrine uniquely has no traditional honden (main sanctuary). Instead, worshippers face Mount Moriya (守屋山) to the southwest, which serves as the shintai (sacred body) of the deity. A sacred rock (iwakura) marks where the Suwa deity is believed to descend.

**Onbashira Sacred Pillars:** Four massive fir tree trunks stand at the corners of the shrine compound, erected during the most recent Onbashira festival. These pillars, each over 17 meters tall and weighing up to 10 tons, are replaced every six years.

**Virgin Forest Setting:** Kamisha Honmiya is surrounded by virgin forest, providing a serene and sacred atmosphere. Many trees are centuries old, contributing to the shrine's ancient spiritual character.

The lower shrines are close to each other and can be visited together if time permits, though Kamisha Honmiya offers the most comprehensive experience for route travelers with limited time.

### Goshuin Stamp Collecting

Each of the four shrines offers its unique goshuin (shrine seal). Visitors can purchase a goshuincho (stamp book) at the first shrine visited. Completing the collection from all four shrines comes with a commemorative souvenir, making this a meaningful way to document the pilgrimage. Typical donation: ¥300-500 per shrine.
