Matsumoto Castle stands as one of Japan's most magnificent and complete original castles, designated as a National Treasure in 1936 (structures designated in 1952). Originally known as Fukashi Castle, this flatland castle was constructed during the turbulent Sengoku Period (Warring States Period) between 1593-1594 under the rule of Lord Ishikawa Kazumasa and his son Yasunaga.

The castle's most distinctive feature is its stunning black-lacquered exterior, which earned it the nickname "Karasu-jō" (Crow Castle). This dark facade is thought to be a tribute to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a powerful samurai and daimyō of the late Sengoku period. The main keep is the oldest surviving five-tiered, six-story castle tower remaining in Japan, maintaining its original wooden interiors and external stonework.

The castle complex consists of five surviving original structures in the main keep area, all designated as National Treasures. Throughout its history, Matsumoto Castle was ruled by men under powerful samurai including Takeda Shingen, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. [🔗](https://att-japan.net/en/matsumoto-castle/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The castle represents a significant transition in Japanese history. While the main keep is a product of a time of war, featuring defensive architecture including a hidden sixth floor, narrow windows for archers, and openings for dropping stones on attackers, the later addition of the elegant Tsukimi Yagura (Moon-Viewing Tower) during the peaceful Edo period illustrates the shift from military fortification to a residence for the ruling lord.

**Route Context:** Matsumoto Castle serves as a cultural transition marker on the journey from Mount Fuji through the Japanese Alps to the Hida region, representing the shift from natural sacred landscapes to human military architecture and samurai culture before reaching Takayama's merchant heritage.
