Genbudo Park is home to five remarkable basalt caves formed over 1.6 million years ago when volcanic magma cooled, contracted, and formed vertical cracks creating distinctive polygonal columnar joints. The caves are named after Chinese mythological creatures: Genbudo (Black Tortoise), Seiryudo (Azure Dragon), Byakkodo (White Tiger), and Kita/Minami Suzakudo (North/South Phoenix).

## Cultural & Religious Significance

**Scientific Historical Importance**: The site holds exceptional scientific significance as the location where Japanese geophysicist Motonori Matuyama first discovered evidence of Earth's magnetic field reversals in 1926. This discovery established the "Matuyama Reversed Polarity Epoch" (2.58-0.77 million years ago) and was foundational to the development of paleomagnetology and plate tectonics theory.

**International Recognition**: In 2022, the site was recognized as one of the "100 Geological Heritage Sites of the World" by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The park was designated as a National Natural Monument in 1931 and is part of the San'in Kaigan UNESCO Global Geopark. [ðŸ”—](https://visitkinosaki.com/things-to-do/genbudo-park/)

**Historical Context**: During the Edo Period (1603-1867), the caves were used as a quarry, creating the recessed areas still visible today while revealing the remarkable geological formations that would later contribute to major scientific discoveries.

## The Experience

**Five Caves Walking Route**: Visitors follow a well-maintained 30-minute walking route connecting all five caves, each showcasing different aspects of the hexagonal basalt formations. The main Genbudo Cave stands 33 meters high with the longest columnar joints of all five caves. Seiryudo Cave offers particularly photogenic reflections in an adjacent pond.

**Educational Opportunities**: Free guided tours available with advance reservation (30 minutes) with English-speaking staff to explain geological significance. Educational materials available in English about basalt formation and magnetic reversal discovery. [ðŸ”—](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/1119105/genbudo-park)

**Museum CafÃ© Experience**: Restaurant and cafÃ© offer terrace seating with panoramic views over the Maruyama River and surrounding mountains, serving seasonal dishes using local ingredients including Stork Natural Rice. [ðŸ”—](https://visitkinosaki.com/things-to-do/genbudo-museum/)

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Physical Requirements**: Well-maintained walking paths suitable for families with children, but multiple stone stairs and uneven paths require comfortable walking shoes. Some elevation changes to reach Byakko-dong and Suzaku-dong caves. Not fully wheelchair accessible due to stairs and terrain. [ðŸ”—](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/14379/)

**Photography Strategy**: Best shots at Seiryudo Cave with pond reflections, main Genbudo Cave showing full 33-meter height of columnar joints, evening illuminations during October visit period, and museum terrace for panoramic river and mountain views.

**Crowd Management**: Early morning visits (9:00 AM opening) provide best lighting and fewer crowds. Weekday visits generally quieter than weekends. Re-entry allowed same day with stamped ticket before 4:30 PM.

**Weather Preparation**: Light jacket for October weather and cooler cave temperatures, comfortable walking shoes essential for uneven stone paths and stairs, camera with good low-light capability for cave illuminations.

**Cultural Etiquette**: Respect geological conservation - no touching or climbing on formations. Photography allowed but be mindful of other visitors in confined cave spaces. Large luggage not recommended due to multiple stairs throughout site.

**Money-Saving Options**: Free luggage storage available at museum for day visitors. Museum shop accessible without admission fee. Ferry service from Genbudo Station requires advance phone call with arrival time and is subject to weather conditions.

**Integration with Kinosaki**: Perfect morning or afternoon excursion providing educational contrast to cultural hot spring town atmosphere, allowing combination with onsen bathing and traditional town exploration for comprehensive regional experience.
