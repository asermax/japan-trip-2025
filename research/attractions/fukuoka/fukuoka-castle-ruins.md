Fukuoka Castle (福岡城, Fukuoka-jō), also known as Maizuru Castle (舞鶴城) or Seki Castle (石城), represents one of Japan's most significant castle ruins and stands as a testament to the power of the Kuroda clan during the Edo period. Built strategically on Fukusaki hill in central Fukuoka, the castle complex originally covered 47,000 square meters and featured an impressive 47 turrets (yaguras), making it the largest castle in the Kyushu region.

The castle's construction began in 1601 under Kuroda Nagamasa, who received the Chikuzen Province domain worth 520,000 koku as a reward for supporting Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara. The design is attributed to Nagamasa's father, Kuroda Yoshitaka (also known as Kuroda Kanbei), a renowned strategist of the time. The castle served as the seat of power for the Kuroda clan for more than two centuries until the abolition of the feudal system in 1870. [🔗](https://article.bespes-jt.com/en/article/fukuoka-castle)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

During the Meiji Restoration, most of the castle structures were deliberately demolished as unwanted symbols of the feudal past, leaving only the stone walls, moats, and a few turrets. Among the surviving structures, the Tamon-Yagura Turret, completed in 1854, has been designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan. This impressive structure consists of a two-story corner tower connected to a 54-meter-long flat tower, divided into 16 small rooms, and stands as the only surviving turret from the original 47.

The site achieved National Historic Site designation by the Japanese government on August 29, 1957, recognizing its cultural and historical significance. In 1987, the ruins of a korokan (ancient guest house for foreign diplomats) were discovered within the castle grounds, proving Fukuoka's importance as a port of entry to Japan during the Heian period (794-1185). This korokan is the only one of its kind discovered in Japan and can be viewed for free. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4806.html)
