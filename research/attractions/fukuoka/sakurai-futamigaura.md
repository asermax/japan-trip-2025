Sakurai Futamigaura stands as one of Japan's most spiritually significant and photographically stunning coastal landmarks. Located in the northern part of Itoshima City within Genkai Quasi-National Park, this sacred site combines natural beauty with profound Shinto religious meaning. The location is distinguished by its pure white torii gate standing in the sea and two rocky outcrops called Meoto Iwa (å¤«å©¦å²©), or "Wedded Rocks," positioned approximately 150 meters offshore.

Unlike the famous Futamigaura in Ise (Mie Prefecture) known for sunrise views, Sakurai Futamigaura is celebrated as "Sunset Futamigaura" for its spectacular evening views over the Genkai Sea. The site has earned recognition on Japan's "Top 100 Beaches" and "Top 100 Sunset Views" lists, making it one of Fukuoka's most photographed and spiritually significant destinations.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The site belongs to Sakurai Shrine, a designated Fukuoka Prefecture cultural property revered as a sacred place dedicated to Izanagi and Izanami, the deities from Japanese creation mythology. The larger rock (11.8m high) represents the male deity/husband, while the smaller rock (11.2m high) represents the female deity/wife. These sacred rocks are bound together by a massive shimenawa rope - a 30-meter long, 50cm diameter sacred rope weighing approximately one ton that symbolizes the divine union and spiritual connection between the creation deities.

Each year between late April and early May, community members conduct a sacred ceremony to replace the massive rope during spring tide. This ton-weight rope replacement requires over 50 participants and represents renewal of sacred bonds between the deities. The wedding rock symbolism makes it a popular destination for couples and those seeking marital harmony blessings. [ðŸ”—](https://kami-shrine.com/journal/the-meaning-of-torii)
