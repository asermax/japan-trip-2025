Maizuru Park is a comprehensive urban park built on the historic grounds of Fukuoka Castle (also known as Maizuru Castle), which was the largest castle on Kyushu during the Edo Period (1603-1868). [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4806.html) The park uniquely combines historical preservation with modern recreational facilities, creating a space where ancient heritage and contemporary life coexist in the heart of Fukuoka city.

The castle was constructed between 1601 and 1607 by Kuroda Nagamasa, who was appointed lord of the Chikuzen feudal domain for his support of Tokugawa Ieyasu during the battle of Sekigahara. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka_Castle) The Kuroda clan ruled from this strategic location for more than two centuries until the abolition of the feudal system in 1870.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Though most of the original structures were dismantled after the Meiji Restoration, the park preserves impressive stone walls, gates, and the historically significant Tamon-Yagura turret, which is designated as a National Important Cultural Property. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/12579) The Tamon-Yagura represents the only surviving Edo-period structure from the original 47 turrets, featuring a two-story corner tower connected to a 54-meter-long flat building.

Archaeological excavations in 1987 revealed the ruins of a Korokan, an ancient guest house for foreign diplomats from the Heian period (794-1185), proving Fukuoka's historical importance as Japan's diplomatic gateway to Asia. [ðŸ”—](https://www.crossroadfukuoka.jp/en/spot/12573) This discovery makes Maizuru Park the only location in Japan where such diplomatic facilities have been positively identified, highlighting Fukuoka's 2,000-year history as an international gateway city.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Timing for October 31 - November 1 Visit:**
Early autumn colors beginning to appear; peak foliage occurs mid to late November. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/fukuoka-autumn-leaves-guide/) Pleasant temperatures ideal for outdoor exploration, comfortable for 2-3 hour visits. Moderate visitor numbers outside peak cherry blossom and peak autumn seasons.

**Photography Strategy:**
Stone walls particularly photogenic during sunrise and sunset lighting. Golden hour lighting enhances castle stone walls; morning visits offer softer light for historical structures. Capture early autumn colors of ginkgo and maple trees against historic stone walls.

**Optimal Visit Order:**
Start at Visitor Center first for context, then explore grounds, finish at Korokan Exhibition Hall. Begin visit at 9:00 AM when facilities open to avoid crowds and enjoy morning light. Wear comfortable shoes for stone pathways and varied terrain across 38.2-acre site. [ðŸ”—](https://us.trip.com/moments/detail/fukuoka-576-119625179/)
