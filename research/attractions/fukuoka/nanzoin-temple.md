Nanzoin Temple stands as one of Japan's most significant Buddhist sites, serving as the head temple of the Sasaguri pilgrimage route and home to the world's largest bronze reclining Buddha statue. Originally located on Mount Kōya, the temple was relocated to Sasaguri in 1899 after local residents petitioned for 10 years to save it from destruction under anti-Buddhist policies.

The temple belongs to the Shingon sect of Buddhism and houses sacred relics gifted by Myanmar's Buddhist Congress in 1988 - ashes of Gautama Buddha, Ananda, and Maudgalyayana - in recognition of Nanzoin's charitable contributions to Southeast Asian children and medical aid programs.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The centerpiece 41-meter bronze reclining Buddha, known as "Nehanzo" or "Shaka Nehan," depicts the historical Buddha at the moment of his death and entry into nirvana. Completed in 1995 after a ceremonial unveiling attended by 1,300 monks from Myanmar and Nepal, this 300-ton masterpiece contains sand from each of the 88 shrines of the Shikoku pilgrimage stored within a narrow internal hallway.

The temple's relocation story represents remarkable community preservation efforts, with local residents working for a decade to save this sacred site from destruction during Japan's period of Buddhist suppression. The temple now serves as the focal point of the Sasaguri pilgrimage route, a 44-kilometer journey modeled after the famous Shikoku pilgrimage.

## The Experience

The massive bronze reclining Buddha statue depicts Buddha's moment of entering nirvana, with intricate details including symbolic designs on the soles of the feet. Colorful cords attached to Buddha's hand represent the five colors of light from his enlightenment - holding these cords is believed to grant spiritual connection and blessings.

Surrounding the reclining Buddha are 500 statues of Buddha's disciples (arhats), each uniquely carved with individual expressions and postures, representing the community that witnessed Buddha's final moments. The temple complex includes the Shichifukujin Tunnel featuring the Seven Gods of Good Fortune, various smaller shrines and meditation areas, temple pond and mountain stream, and traditional Buddhist architecture in the main hall and bell tower.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Cultural Preparation:** Dress modestly covering shoulders and knees, maintain quiet respectful behavior throughout visit, remove shoes when entering temple buildings, avoid pointing feet toward Buddha statues, and consider small donation (around ¥300-500) for blessings.

**Photography Guidelines:** Photography permitted on temple grounds but forbidden inside buildings. Best lighting during golden hour (early morning/late afternoon). Never climb or touch Buddha statues, and walk backward when leaving Buddha's presence.
