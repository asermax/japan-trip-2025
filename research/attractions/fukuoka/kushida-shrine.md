Kushida Shrine (櫛田神社), affectionately known as "Okushida-san" by locals, stands as Fukuoka's oldest and most revered Shinto shrine, established in 757 CE during Emperor Koken's reign. Built to share a deity with Kushida Shrine in Ise Province, this sacred site serves as the guardian shrine of Hakata and remains the spiritual heart of the district. The shrine is dedicated to Amaterasu-Omikami and Susanoo-no-Mikoto, with the central hall housing Oohatameshi-no-Mikoto, drawing worshippers seeking longevity and business success.

The current main building dates to 1585, rebuilt during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's restoration of Hakata. As the epicenter of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Hakata Gion Yamakasa festival, the shrine displays magnificent decorative yamakasa floats year-round (except June), making it accessible to visitors throughout the year to experience this 770-year-old tradition.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Kushida Shrine represents the spiritual foundation of Hakata's community identity, serving as the guardian shrine for over 1,250 years. The shrine's most significant cultural contribution is the Hakata Gion Yamakasa festival, designated as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, which transforms the city each July as neighborhoods compete in carrying elaborate floats through the streets.

The shrine houses the sacred Kushida Ginkgo Tree, a millennium-old tree designated as a Fukuoka Prefecture cultural property and mentioned in the traditional Hakata Iwai Uta celebration song. The tree's golden autumn foliage creates stunning visuals during late October visits, connecting visitors to centuries of seasonal celebrations.
