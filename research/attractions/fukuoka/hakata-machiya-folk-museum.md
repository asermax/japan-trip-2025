The Hakata Machiya Folk Museum serves as a living window into the traditional lifestyle and culture of Hakata during the Meiji (1868-1912) and Taisho (1912-1926) periods. [ðŸ”—](https://gofukuoka.jp/spots/detail/26812) The centerpiece is an authentic mid-Meiji period machiya that once served as both residence and textile workshop for Hakata-ori weavers. This building was carefully dismantled, relocated from its original site, and reconstructed across from Kushida Shrine, where it now holds designation as a Tangible Cultural Property of Fukuoka City.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The museum complex consists of three interconnected buildings: the historic Machiya Building, the modern Exhibition Building, and a Souvenir Shop, creating a comprehensive cultural experience that bridges past and present. [ðŸ”—](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/13250/) The traditional architecture features characteristic elements including narrow frontages that open into surprisingly spacious interiors with high atriums, thick wooden pillars with decorative carvings, and connecting corridors that create the distinctive "tori niwa" (through-passage) layout typical of merchant houses.
