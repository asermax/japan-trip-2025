Munakata Taisha represents one of Japan's most ancient and significant Shinto shrine complexes, achieving UNESCO World Heritage status in 2017 as part of the "Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region." The complex consists of three distinct shrines dedicated to the three Munakata goddesses - daughters of Amaterasu Omikami, the most revered deity in Japanese Shinto tradition.

The shrine complex served as the spiritual guardian of the ancient maritime trade route between Japan, Korea, and China from the 4th-9th centuries, resulting in the accumulation of over 80,000 ritual artifacts that are collectively designated as National Treasures of Japan.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

**The Three Sacred Sites:** Hetsumiya (main shrine on Kyushu mainland, most accessible, rebuilt in 1578), Nakatsumiya (located on Oshima Island, accessible by ferry, with 16th-century buildings), and Okitsumiya (the sacred "forbidden island" of Okinoshima, off-limits except to Shinto priests, considered a living kami itself). [ðŸ”—](https://www.okinoshima-heritage.jp/en/know/hetsumiya.html)

The shrine honors three deities known as the "Three Deities of Miyajidake Shrine": the three Munakata goddesses who served as guardians of the ancient maritime trade routes. The site contains over 80,000 ritual artifacts including triangular-rimmed bronze mirrors, gold rings, and Persian cut glass, representing 1,500 years of maritime cultural exchange between Japan and continental Asia.
