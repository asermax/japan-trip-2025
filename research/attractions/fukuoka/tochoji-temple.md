Tōchō-ji (東長寺) stands as a monument to Japanese Buddhist history, representing over 1,200 years of continuous spiritual practice. Founded in 806 AD by the revered monk Kukai (Kobo Daishi) upon his return from Tang Dynasty China, this temple holds the distinction of being the oldest Shingon Buddhism temple on Kyushu island. The temple's name, meaning "so that esoteric Buddhism may be transmitted eastward for a long time," reflects Kukai's vision for spreading Tantric Buddhism throughout Japan.

Originally situated by the seaside, the temple was relocated to its current site in the late 16th century by Kuroda Tadayuki, the second lord of Chikuzen province, after a fire destroyed the original buildings. The temple serves as the burial place for the second, third, and eighth lords of the Kuroda clan, cementing its role in Fukuoka's feudal history. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/13374/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Tochoji Temple represents the introduction of Shingon esoteric Buddhism to Kyushu, marking Kukai's mission to establish Buddhist teachings throughout Japan after his transformative studies in China. The temple's founding in 806 AD coincided with Kukai's development of the Shingon school, making it a foundational site for this major Buddhist tradition in southern Japan.

The temple's most significant cultural treasure is the Fukuoka Daibutsu, Japan's largest wooden seated Buddha statue at 10.8 meters tall and weighing 30 tons. Completed in 1992 after four years of meticulous craftsmanship, the height symbolically represents the 108 human troubles in Buddhist teaching. The statue serves as both an artistic masterpiece and a focal point for meditation and spiritual reflection. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/13374/)
