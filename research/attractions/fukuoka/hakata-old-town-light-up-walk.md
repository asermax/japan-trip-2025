The Hakata Old Town Light-up Walk represents one of Fukuoka's most significant cultural illumination events during the autumn "Akihaku" festival season. This extraordinary annual event, running since 2006, transforms the historic Hakata district into a magical nightscape where normally closed temples and shrines open their doors to reveal illuminated gardens, halls, and architectural treasures. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fukuoka-now.com/en/hakata-old-town-light-up-walk-2024/) The event celebrates over 1,000 years of Buddhist heritage in what was once Japan's largest medieval trading port, earning the district its nickname "Temple Town" for its concentration of religious sites within walking distance of modern Hakata Station.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The illumination celebrates Hakata's role as the center of international trade during the medieval period (12th-16th centuries), when the district hosted an international community including a Chinatown.

[ðŸ”—](https://gofukuoka.jp/articles/detail/628dc12c-e9cc-441a-8b08-6c5e4a9aff66)

The event features fourteen participating venues including major temples like Tochoji (home to Japan's largest wooden seated Buddha), Kushida Shrine (dating to the mid-8th century), and Jotenji Temple (founding site of udon and soba noodle traditions).
