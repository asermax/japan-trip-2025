Takachiho Gorge is a narrow chasm cut through volcanic rock by the Gokase River, forming one of Kyushu's most spectacular natural landscapes. The gorge's nearly sheer 80-100 meter high cliffs are made of volcanic basalt columns that resemble dragon scales, formed over 100,000 years ago after eruptions from nearby Mount Aso. [🔗](https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/see-and-do/spots/takachiho-gorge/) The chasm narrows to just 3 meters wide at its tightest point called Yaritobi. [🔗](https://www.japan-travel-note.com/posts/249)

The centerpiece is the 17-meter high Manai Falls (真名井の滝), which according to the Kojiki (Japan's oldest historical record from 712 CE), was created by the god Amenomuraka. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/) The falls are designated as one of Japan's Top 100 Waterfalls and cascade dramatically into the emerald-green river below.

Designated a National Scenic Spot and Natural Monument in 1934, Takachiho Gorge first appeared in Japan's historical records in the Kojiki (712 CE) and the Nihon Shoki (720 CE) as an important stage for Japanese mythology. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The gorge holds profound mythological significance as the land where Ninigi descended from the heavens, sent by Amaterasu, the sun goddess. The famous legend tells of Amaterasu hiding in a cave (Ama-no-Iwato) to escape her brother's rampage, depriving the world of light until the goddess Ame-no-Uzume performed a provocative dance that lured her out. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/)

This place of spectacular beauty is said to have the power to transmit spiritual energy to visitors, to heal them physically or simply to recharge their batteries. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/) Takachiho represents the mythological birthplace of Japan, where gods descended from heaven and the sun goddess Amaterasu's legend unfolded.

The Manai Falls itself is named in ancient mythology as the creation of god Amenomuraka, adding layers of sacred significance to this natural wonder. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/takachiho-gorge-legends/)
