Taketa City is a historic castle town in southwestern Oita Prefecture, home to approximately 23,000 people, centered around the legendary Oka Castle ruins. The castle, perched 325 meters above sea level atop Tenjinyama mountain, was originally constructed in 1185 by local warlord Ogata Koreyoshi to offer refuge to the legendary samurai Minamoto no Yoshitsune during his flight from his brother, the first shogun. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oka_Castle)

The castle earned fame as an "impregnable fortress" throughout the turbulent Sengoku (Warring States) Period, withstanding numerous assaults including a major 1586 invasion by the powerful Shimazu clan. The Nakagawa clan ruled the Oka Domain from Taketa for 13 consecutive generations (277 years) until the Meiji Restoration in 1871, developing the surrounding castle town with organized samurai, merchant, and temple districts that define Taketa's historic character today.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Following the Meiji government's 1871 order to decommission all feudal castles, Oka Castle's structures were dismantled by 1874, leaving only the massive stone walls visible today. These atmospheric ruins inspired composer Rentaro Taki—who spent his childhood exploring the castle grounds—to write the famous song "Kojo no Tsuki" (The Moon over the Ruined Castle), which became a cultural icon included in school curricula and later recorded by international artists including Thelonious Monk and the Scorpions. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentar%C5%8D_Taki)

Before the Edo Period's strict isolationist policies, Taketa was one of eight major Christian missionary centers in Japan under the Otomo clan, whose leader Otomo Sorin converted to Christianity. After Christianity was banned in the early 17th century, many local converts went into hiding, creating a unique "Hidden Christian" (Kirishitan) legacy including the remarkable Christian Cave Chapel—the only artificial Christian cave chapel in Japan that endured over 400 years of persecution.
