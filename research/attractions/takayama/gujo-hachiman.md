*Historic castle town of Gujo Hachiman with traditional waterways and castle perched on Mount Hachiman*

Gujo Hachiman is a beautifully preserved castle town that has maintained its Edo-period character for over 400 years. Located at the confluence of the Yoshida, Kodara, and Nagara rivers in Gifu Prefecture, this "water city" is renowned for its pristine waterway system that flows through every neighborhood. The town centers around Gujo Hachiman Castle, a wooden reconstruction perched 350 meters above town on Mount Hachiman, earning the nickname "Castle in the Sky" when morning mists surround its base.

The waterways weren't original to the town but were constructed after a devastating 1652 fire by feudal lord Tsunetomo Endo for fire protection. These channels bring river water directly to residents' homes via an ingenious system of mizufune (water boats) - layered wooden basins where the top spigot provides drinking water while lower levels are used for washing vegetables and feeding fish that act as natural filters. The town is also the birthplace of Japan's food replica industry, producing 60% of all sampuru (food replicas) sold nationwide.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Historically, Gujo Hachiman served as an important trade center with districts named for specific crafts - Shokunin-machi (craftsmen's town) and Kajiya-machi (blacksmith town). The water management system represents a remarkable example of Edo-period engineering and community cooperation, where residents maintain the waterways through a cooperative cleaning system that has operated for over 350 years.

The castle town planning reflects traditional Japanese urban design principles, with the samurai district (Yanagimachi) featuring distinctive winged walls between houses for privacy and protection. The preservation of traditional architecture and water systems provides insight into sustainable community management practices that modern urban planners study as models for ecological city design.
