Kamikochi is a pristine 15-kilometer-long plateau along the Azusa River, nestled at approximately 1,500 meters above sea level in the heart of the Northern Japan Alps. Often called the "Japanese Yosemite Valley," this remote mountainous highland valley represents one of Japan's most significant conservation achievements. The valley received the rare dual designation as both a National Special Place of Scenic Beauty and Special Natural Monument in 1952, recognizing its alpine flora, glacial landforms, and dramatic Hotaka skyline.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Once revered as the sacred realm of "Kami-g≈çchi" ("within the divine enclosure"), Kamikochi still retains a strong atmosphere of nature worship centered on the Okumiya of Hotaka Shrine. The valley showcases ancient glacial valleys intertwined with wetlands born of volcanic activity, bordered by Mount Hotaka to the north and the active volcano Mount Yake to the south, with surrounding peaks reaching 3,190 meters.

The area represents Japan's conservation philosophy and the spiritual connection between nature and Japanese culture, with strict protection measures that include complete prohibition of private vehicles since 1994.
