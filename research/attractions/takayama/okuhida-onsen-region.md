The Okuhida Onsen Region represents Japan's most extensive collection of outdoor hot springs, nestled deep within the Northern Japan Alps in Gifu Prefecture. This remarkable area comprises five distinct hot spring villages - Hirayu, Fukuji, Shin-Hirayu, Tochio, and Shin-Hotaka - each offering unique mineral-rich waters sourced from different geological formations. The region boasts over 100 outdoor bathing facilities, earning its designation as a National Hot Spring Health Resort by the Ministry of the Environment.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The hot springs derive their therapeutic properties from volcanic activity in the region, particularly from Mount Yake-dake and Mount Norikura, with snowmelt from the Northern Alps being heated underground before emerging as mineral-rich springs. The waters contain beneficial minerals including sodium, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate of soda, and sulfur, creating distinctly different bathing experiences across the five villages.

Hirayu Onsen, the oldest and largest village, traces its discovery to the 1560s when soldiers serving under the legendary warlord Takeda Shingen were allegedly led to the springs by a white monkey while seeking refuge during their Hida Province campaign. This historical connection adds cultural depth to the natural beauty, embodying Japan's tradition of hot spring healing culture. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1263/)
