The Shin-Hotaka Ropeway is a remarkable feat of engineering and Japan's premier mountain access attraction, featuring the country's only double-decker gondola system. Opening in 1970 and renovated in summer 2020, this two-stage ropeway lifts visitors over 1,000 meters up the Hotaka Mountain Range to reach an observation deck at 2,156 meters above sea level. The ropeway provides spectacular access to the Northern Alps (Hida Mountains) within Chubu-Sangaku National Park, offering year-round mountain experiences that change dramatically with the seasons.

The attraction earned two stars in the Michelin Green Guide Japan, highlighting its international recognition for providing unparalleled 360-degree panoramic views of Japan's third-highest peak, Oku-Hotakadake (3,190m), along with Mt. Kasagatake, Mt. Yarigatake, Mt. Nishihotakadake, and Mt. Yakedake. Cultural significance extends to its role as a gateway making the sacred Northern Alps accessible to all visitors, from children to seniors, without requiring mountaineering expertise.
