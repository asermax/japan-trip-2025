Hida-Furukawa is a historic town in Gifu Prefecture that preserves the authentic atmosphere of traditional Japan, earning it the nickname "Little Kyoto of Hida." The town's most distinctive feature is the Seto Canal (Setogawa) that runs through the historic district, lined with traditional white-walled storehouses (shirakabe dozo) belonging to centuries-old sake breweries. Over 1,000 brilliantly colored koi carp swim in these pristine canals from April through November, creating one of Japan's most photogenic streetscapes.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The town was formed through the merger of Furukawa, Kawai, Miyagawa, and Kamioka in 2004, but its cultural heritage dates back over 400 years to the Edo period. The canal system originally served practical purposes - locals used the pristine waters for washing vegetables. In 1968, authorities introduced thousands of carp to naturally clean the water, creating an enduring symbol of community care for the environment.

Hida-Furukawa gained international recognition as a filming location for the 2016 anime film "Your Name" (Kimi no Na wa), transforming it from a relatively unknown rural town into a major anime pilgrimage destination. The town's traditional crafts, particularly woodworking by the legendary "Hida Takumi" master builders, have contributed to imperial palaces and temples in Nara and Kyoto for over 1,300 years.
