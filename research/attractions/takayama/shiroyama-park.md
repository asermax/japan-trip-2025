Shiroyama Park (ÂüéÂ±±ÂÖ¨Âúí, Shiroyama K≈çen), meaning "Castle Mountain Park," is a 24.3-hectare (60-acre) public park established in 1873 on the former site of Takayama Castle. The park serves as both a natural refuge and historical monument, preserving the legacy of the Kanamori family who ruled Hida Province for over 100 years. Built by Kanamori Nagachika in 1588 under orders from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Takayama Castle was considered one of Japan's finest mountain castles during the Warring States period.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Though dismantled in 1695 when the region came under direct Tokugawa shogunate control, the site retains its original stone walls, foundations, and moats, offering visitors a tangible connection to Japan's feudal era. The park rises to 687 meters above sea level and has been designated as one of Japan's Top 100 Forest Bathing Sites, recognized for its pristine natural environment and therapeutic forest atmosphere.

A statue of Kanamori Nagachika, the castle's founder, stands prominently within the park as a reminder of the area's feudal heritage. The preserved stone walls and foundations provide insight into 16th-century mountain fortress design and the strategic importance of controlling the Hida region during Japan's unification period.
