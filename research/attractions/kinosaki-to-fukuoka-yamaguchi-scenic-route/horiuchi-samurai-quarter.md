The Horiuchi Samurai Quarter represents the heart of Hagi's preserved castle town, occupying the northwest area from Hagishi Central Park to the former Hagi Castle site approximately 1.5 km northwest. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/hiroshima/attractions-excursions/hagi-city-guide) The name "Horiuchi" means "inside the moat," reflecting its proximity to Hagi Castle. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japanhoppers.com/en/chugoku/hagi/kanko/2609) This area was home to wealthy samurai and merchants during the Edo period, featuring stately manors of high-ranked vassals behind tall earthen walls interspersed with impressive gates.

The district is renowned for **Horiuchi Kaimagari**â€”narrow defensive alleys with earthen walls on either side and sharp right-angle turns designed to confuse intruders. The term "kaimagari" derives from "kai" (key) and "magaru" (to turn), describing the key-like 90-degree angles throughout the street network. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mlit.go.jp/tagengo-db/en/R2-00350.html) These lanes were designed to disorientate attackers by obscuring landmarks and creating a maze-like defensive system. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6150.html)

The streets showcase **namako-kabe** (sea-cucumber walls)â€”distinctive white-plastered and black-tiled earthen walls with striking white crisscross patterns. Called "namako walls" because of the rounded joints resembling sea cucumbers, they were originally designed to protect plaster against weather erosion. [ðŸ”—](http://www.japanese-castle-explorer.com/namako_wall.html) [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namako_wall) Kikuya Yokocho is particularly renowned for its brilliant white and black namako-kabe walls, designated as one of Japan's "100 Best Roads."

During summer months, bright orange natsumikan citrus fruits hang over the preserved earthen walls. The original town plan from the Edo period remains intact, creating an authentic historical atmosphere.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The Horiuchi district served as the residential area for wealthy samurai and merchants during the Edo period. The defensive kaimagari street layout with sharp right-angle turns was specifically designed to confuse invading forces and prevent clear lines of sight.

### Walking Circuit Recommendations

**Recommended Route:** Start from Central Park/Meirin Bus Center (tourist information available) â†’ Walk through Kikuya Yokocho (most scenic lane) â†’ Explore Edoya and Iseya Yokocho â†’ Visit 2-3 selected samurai residences based on Â¥310 combination ticket â†’ Continue to castle ruins area (additional 0.5-1 km)

**Circuit Distance:** Main Horiuchi district spans approximately 1.5 km from Central Park to castle ruins, with individual lanes adding additional walking distance.

**Walking Time:** 1.5-2 hours for core district street walking without entering residences; 2.5-3.5 hours including visits to 2-3 samurai residences; Full half-day (3-4 hours) for comprehensive exploration including castle ruins

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Driving Visitor Strategy:** Park at Shizuki Park (castle ruins, 51 spaces) or Central Park area and explore on foot/bicycle. Historic district compact and walkableâ€”avoid moving car between sites within 1.5 km Horiuchi extent. Pedestrian/bicycle preferred in core areas once parked. Combined visit strategy: Castle ruins (1 hour) + Horiuchi district (2 hours) = 3-hour minimum commitment.

**Best Photo Spots:** Kikuya Yokocho (most picturesque narrow lane, designated one of Japan's "100 Best Roads"), namako-kabe walls with distinctive cross-hatching, kaimagari lanes with defensive right-angle turns, earthen walls and gates demonstrating samurai district hierarchy.

**Money-Saving Options:** Streets completely free to walk and explore. Â¥310 combination ticket provides access to 8-9 historic residences vs. Â¥100 each individually (significant savings if visiting 3+ sites). Select 2-3 most significant samurai residences rather than attempting all paid sites. Free tourist maps from Meirin Gakusha Tourist Information next to Meirin Bus Center. Bicycle rental provides economical way to cover district efficiently. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6151.html) [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6155.html)

**Cultural Etiquette:** Many samurai residences privately ownedâ€”respect property boundaries and posted signs. Photography may be restricted inside buildingsâ€”check signage before taking photos. Remove shoes when entering traditional buildings that permit interior access. Maintain quiet respect in historic areas; residential district still functions as living neighborhood. Observe closure days (particularly Wednesdays for some residences).

**Weather Preparation:** October weather ideal with 10-17Â°C temperatures requiring layered clothing. Comfortable walking shoes essential for extensive street exploration on traditional surfaces. Light rain jacket recommended for potential autumn showers. Sun protection for daytime photography. Evening jacket for lantern viewing during potential Kimono Week events.

**Visit Strategy:** Focus on quality over quantity - select 2-3 most meaningful samurai residences using combination ticket. Prioritize street walking and lane photography (completely free) over attempting every paid residence. Start with Kikuya Yokocho as signature photo location. Allow time for spontaneous discoveryâ€”grid layout encourages exploration beyond main routes. Combine with castle ruins visit for comprehensive historical understanding.

**Route Integration:** Horiuchi district functions as central walking area connecting castle site to Central Park. As part of Hagi exploration from castle ruins, the district provides authentic samurai residential experience. Given 5:00 PM closing time for most attractions, afternoon arrival by early afternoon (1:00-2:00 PM) allows 3-4 hours for castle ruins and Horiuchi district combined exploration.

**Photography Conditions:** Daytime best lighting for namako-kabe wall details and architectural features. Morning (9:00 AM) offers fewer visitors for unobstructed street photography. Evening bamboo lantern lighting during Kimono Week creates unique atmosphere (if festival schedule aligns). Kikuya Yokocho most picturesque lane for signature Hagi photos.
