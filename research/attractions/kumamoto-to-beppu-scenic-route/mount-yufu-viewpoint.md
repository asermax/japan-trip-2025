Mount Yufu (Yufudake, 由布岳) is an active volcanic mountain standing at 1,583.3 meters, located on the border of Yufu and Beppu in Oita Prefecture within Aso-Kuju National Park. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Yufu) Known affectionately as "Bungo Fuji" due to its elegant, Fuji-like conical silhouette, the mountain features distinctive twin peaks (Nishi-mine/West Peak and Higashi-mine/East Peak) separated by an ancient volcanic crater called Ubagauji. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/711/)

The mountain serves as the symbolic landmark of Yufuin and the Yamanami Highway, visible from multiple viewpoints along the scenic route and dominating the landscape of the entire Yufuin basin. For car travelers on November 2nd, this location offers flexible options: quick roadside viewpoint stops with spectacular photography opportunities, or a challenging 4-5 hour summit hike through autumn foliage with 360-degree panoramic views.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Mount Yufu is far more than a scenic mountain - it is a sacred peak woven deeply into Japan's cultural and spiritual heritage since ancient times. The mountain appears in the Manyoshu (Japan's oldest poetry collection, compiled after 759 AD) as "Momen-yama" (Mulberry Cotton Mountain), named after the kouzo (paper mulberry) trees whose fibers were used to make cotton-like material. [🔗](https://www.city.yufu.oita.jp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mtyufumapeng.pdf) One ancient poem beautifully captures the mountain's essence: "Girls' loose hair seen around the house, strung like clouds on the cotton mountain."

The mountain's elegant conical shape has made it an object of religious worship for centuries, with its beautiful silhouette earning reverence from residents living at its foothills. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/attractions/detail_1065.html) Every May, the "Mountain Opening Ceremony" is held on the second Sunday to pray for climbers' safety, reinforcing its sacred status and drawing many visitors for commemorative performances. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/attractions/detail_1065.html)

Geologically, Mount Yufu is an active andesitic volcano, specifically a tholoid (lava dome), with its last major eruption occurring approximately 2,200 years ago. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Yufu) Though classified as active, it has remained dormant throughout recorded history. The twin peaks formation resulted from its volcanic activity - the slightly taller and more rugged Nishi-mine (West Peak) and the Higashi-mine (East Peak), separated by the ancient Ubagauji crater.

For the residents of Yufuin, Mount Yufu defines their identity and prosperity. The mountain provides the hot spring water that feeds the town's famous onsens and creates the stunning natural backdrop that attracts visitors year-round. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kyushu/oita/yufuin/yufuin-kankouspot/) The famous Kinrin Lake at the mountain's base is fed by springs originating from Mount Yufu, further cementing this symbiotic relationship between mountain and town.

The southern foothills showcase a dramatic traditional practice called Noyaki (field burning) every early spring. This controlled burn is a vital tradition for managing the vast grasslands, clearing dead winter vegetation, eliminating pests, and stimulating fresh growth for the coming season - a powerful spectacle of the deep relationship between the local community and the mountain's ecosystem.

## The Experience

### For Viewpoint Visitors (Non-Hikers)

**Yamanami Highway Scenic Stops:** Experience Mount Yufu's ever-changing perspectives as you drive the famous Yamanami Highway. The mountain serves as a constant companion and signature landmark throughout the route, with its twin peaks appearing dramatically different from various angles. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/yamanami-highway-scenic-drive/)

**Sagiridai Overlook Experience:** At elevation 680m, this premier observation deck offers the most comprehensive views of Mount Yufu towering over the Yufuin basin. On autumn and winter mornings, witness the spectacular "sea of clouds" phenomenon where low-lying clouds fill the valley while the mountain peaks emerge majestically above. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kyushu/oita/yufuin/yufuin-kankouspot/) The overlook includes a shop and rest area, making it an ideal break point during your drive.

**Best Times:** Early morning (6:00-8:00 AM) - prime time for "sea of clouds" phenomenon and morning mist at Kinrin Lake (autumn/winter specialty). [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/11555/) Late afternoon - beautiful golden light on the mountain for photography. Clear days essential for distant visibility - on clear days, even Shikoku island is visible from elevated viewpoints. [🔗](https://hikesinjapan.yamakei-online.com/course/107.php)

### For Hikers

**Trail Routes:** Three trails extend from east, south, and west sides of the mountain, with the **Front (South) Trail from Yufu Tozanguchi** being the most popular and accessible main route. [🔗](https://hikesinjapan.yamakei-online.com/course/107.php)

**Trail Difficulty:** Overall rating - Challenging route, 4.0-mile out-and-back. East Peak - suitable for beginners and intermediate hikers, involves light scrambling, more accessible. West Peak - requires technical scrambling, steep and precipitous rock ridge with supportive chains, recommended for experienced hikers. Crater Traverse (Ohachimawari Course) - expert-level only, northern rim is especially risky requiring rock climbing without chains. [🔗](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/oita/mount-yufu-main-trail-east-peak) [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/711/) [🔗](https://hikesinjapan.yamakei-online.com/course/107.php) [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1023445-d1424998-Reviews-Mt_Yufu-Yufu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

**Time Estimates:** To East Peak: 2-3 hours round trip. To West Peak: 40 minutes from saddle (plus 2 hours to reach saddle), very steep. Full round trip (either peak): 4-5 hours total, including descent time of 1.5 hours.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Driving Considerations:** If time is limited, prioritize **Sagiridai Overlook** for the most impressive single viewpoint with facilities. Allow 20-30 minutes including the shop visit and photo time. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kyushu/oita/yufuin/yufuin-kankouspot/) To witness the sea of clouds phenomenon, arrive at Sagiridai before sunrise or shortly after. The effect typically dissipates by mid-morning as temperatures rise. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/11555/)

**Route Integration:** Mount Yufu serves as the eastern anchor of the Yamanami Highway experience, providing a dramatic introduction to the route's volcanic mountain landscapes. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/yamanami-highway-scenic-drive/) The mountain is visible from multiple points along the highway and establishes the scenic character that continues westward through the Kuju range. As a quick viewpoint stop (15-30 minutes), perfect for breaking up the drive with spectacular mountain views, especially if catching the morning mist at Sagiridai Overlook. As hiking destination (4-6 hours), best as a morning activity starting early (7:00-8:00 AM) to complete before afternoon, then continue to Beppu.

**Cultural Etiquette:** Remember that Mount Yufu is an object of religious worship and holds deep cultural significance. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/attractions/detail_1065.html) Approach the mountain with respect for its sacred status and the centuries of cultural heritage it represents. For hikers: greet fellow hikers with "Konnichiwa", carry out all trash (no facilities on trail), stay on marked trails to protect the volcanic ecosystem. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/711/)

**Budget Considerations:** Free viewpoint access and hiking. Optional expenses include food/souvenirs at Sagiridai facilities or post-hike onsen in Yufuin.
