Tadewara Marsh represents one of Kyushu's most accessible and pristine wetland ecosystems, situated directly alongside the Yamanami Highway in the heart of Aso-Kuju National Park. This 38-hectare intermediate moor sits at 1,000 meters elevation in the western shadow of the Kuju mountain range, offering an immersive experience through a rare high-altitude mountainous wetland.

The site achieved international recognition when it was designated a Ramsar Convention wetland on November 8, 2005, alongside neighboring Bogatsuru, making it Oita Prefecture's first such protected site. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/tadewara-marsh-walking-trail/) This designation highlights its critical ecological importance as habitat for hundreds of plant species and nationally red-listed birds including the Golden Eagle.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The wetland's unique ecosystem is maintained through a centuries-old cultural practice called *noyaki* - controlled burning of the grasslands conducted annually in spring by the local community. This traditional land management prevents the marsh from transitioning into forest, maintains the characteristic grassland vegetation, and supports the lifecycle of native plants that have adapted to this cycle over generations. [ðŸ”—](https://www.oita-tourism.com/en/spots/detail/206)

Formed thousands of years ago when a debris avalanche from Sensuizan volcano dammed the Shirouzu River valley, the resulting lake gradually evolved into the marsh ecosystem visitors experience today. [ðŸ”—](http://www.pref.oita.jp/uploaded/attachment/1228612.pdf) The volcanic landscape remains ever-present, with dramatic peaks including Mt. Mimata's three summits and the actively steaming vents of Mt. Io forming a striking southern backdrop to the golden grasslands.

### Landscape Character

The dominant visual element is the vast expanse of Japanese silver grass (*Miscanthus sinensis* or *susuki*) that transforms through the seasons. In early November, these grasses achieve their most photogenic state - a shimmering golden brown sea stretching across the marsh basin, often described as a "golden carpet" under the clear autumn sky.

The boardwalk creates powerful leading lines drawing the eye toward the dramatic volcanic peaks of the Kuju range, particularly the three summits of Mt. Mimata (1,678m) and the sulfurous vents of Mt. Io. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/tadewara-marsh-walking-trail/)
