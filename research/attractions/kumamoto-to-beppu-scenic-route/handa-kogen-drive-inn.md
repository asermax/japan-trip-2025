Handa Kogen Drive Inn (飯田高原ドライブイン), also known as Iida Kogen Drive Inn, is a comprehensive rest facility strategically positioned at approximately 900 meters elevation on the Iida Plateau. [🔗](https://jaoita.or.jp/learn/shop/7741) The facility serves as a multi-purpose stop combining a restaurant specializing in local Bungo beef cuisine, a JA-operated farmers' market selling fresh highland produce, and essential amenities for travelers navigating the Yamanami Highway.

The drive-inn's location at the junction of the Yamanami Highway and the Gurutto Kuju circular route makes it a natural gathering point for tourists exploring Aso-Kuju National Park. The facility offers panoramic views of the Kuju mountain range (九重連山) from both the restaurant and parking area. [🔗](https://barifuri-oita.com/spot/60796/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The drive-inn's significance is tied to the Yamanami Highway itself, which was officially opened in 1964 as the "Beppu-Aso Road" - one of Japan's first full-scale scenic mountain parkways. The creation of this road was envisioned as early as the 1920s to connect the region's natural wonders, making facilities like Handa Kogen Drive Inn essential service hubs for modern tourism in this historic scenic corridor.
