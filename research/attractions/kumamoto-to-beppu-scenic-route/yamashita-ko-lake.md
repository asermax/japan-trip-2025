Yamashita-ko (Â±±‰∏ãÊπñ) is an artificial lake located in Yufuin-cho, Yufu City, Oita Prefecture, positioned along the celebrated Yamanami Highway (Route 11) within Aso-Kuju National Park. Created for agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric power generation, this reservoir features a 4-kilometer circumference and covers 40 hectares at an elevation ranging from 770 to 836 meters. [üîó](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â±±‰∏ãÊπñ)

The lake is owned by Kyushu Electric Power as a water source forest, primarily planted with cedar and cypress trees, and is designated as part of the "Water Source Forest Hundred Selection." Adjacent to the artificial Yamashita-ko lies Odanoike Pond (Â∞èÁî∞„ÅÆÊ±†), a natural lake where rare small plants called "Sagisou" grow naturally in the southeastern swamp area.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The lake has historical significance from the 1975 Oita Central Earthquake, when the dam broke and most of the lake bottom was exposed, leading to the discovery of archaeological artifacts from the Jomon period. [üîó](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â±±‰∏ãÊπñ)

For Yamanami Highway travelers, Yamashita-ko serves as a recommended scenic stop before continuing to Handa Kogen, a highland plateau in the foothills of the Kuju Renzan Massif. The lake offers a tranquil counterpoint to the dramatic mountain vistas that define this section of one of Kyushu's most celebrated driving routes, known as "The Rooftop of Kyushu."

## The Experience

Yamashita-ko offers driving visitors a peaceful lakeside interlude along the dramatic Yamanami Highway. The reservoir's calm waters provide opportunities for reflection photography, particularly in early morning when the surface is still. The surrounding cedar and cypress forests create a forested frame around the water, contrasting with the open grassland vistas elsewhere on the Yamanami Highway.

Adjacent to Yamashita-ko, Odanoike Pond offers a natural complement to the artificial lake, with its rare Sagisou plants growing in the southeastern swamp‚Äîa botanical curiosity for nature enthusiasts. [üîó](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/yamanami-highway-scenic-drive/)

A lakeside walking path allows visitors to stretch their legs after driving and explore different vantage points around the water. The area previously featured the Kuju Lakeside Hotel (closed in 2007), and a golf course remains on the southern shore, though these are background elements rather than visitor attractions. [üîó](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Â±±‰∏ãÊπñ)

This stop works best as a quick photo opportunity and leg-stretching break rather than an extended destination, fitting naturally into the rhythm of a Yamanami Highway scenic drive between Yufuin's hot spring culture and the highland plateaus of Handa Kogen.

**November 2 Seasonal Context:**

Early November marks excellent timing for autumn colors along the Yamanami Highway. The surrounding Kuju mountain slopes display red and golden hues, with the foliage peak running from mid-October through mid-November. The Yamanami Highway highlands feature abundant susuki (pampas grass) that glows whitish gold in morning light during October and November, particularly visible in the Tadewara Wetlands area near the route. [üîó](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/yamanami-highway-scenic-drive/) [üîó](https://en.japantravel.com/oita/road-trip-the-yamanami-highway/44369)

Early November weather at this elevation (770-836 meters) can be cool, especially in early morning. Temperatures will be pleasant for driving with windows down, but bring a light jacket for stops. Morning light (first few hours after sunrise) provides the best conditions for calm water reflections. Early November sunrise occurs around 6:30 AM in this region, with golden hour lighting ideal for lake photography.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Driving Considerations:** The rest area parking is small‚Äîbe prepared to wait briefly if multiple vehicles are stopped. This works well as the first scenic stop after leaving Yufuin, setting the tone for the highland drive ahead. Combine with stops at Mizuwake Pass and the more dramatic viewpoints at Makinoto Pass higher up the route. Keep your camera readily accessible‚Äîthe lake appears relatively suddenly along the route.

**Route Integration:** As a stop between Yufuin (hot spring culture) and Handa Kogen (highland plateau), the lake provides a transitional experience‚Äîmoving from valley tourism to mountain vistas. The November timing allows for the full autumn color transition visible as you gain elevation.

**Photography Strategy:** Visit in early morning for mirror-like water reflections and softer light. Look for compositions that include the forested shoreline and surrounding mountains. The adjacent Odanoike Pond offers natural alternative to the artificial reservoir aesthetic. Frame shots to capture the contrast between the calm lake waters and the dramatic mountain backdrop visible along the Yamanami Highway.

**Cultural Etiquette:** This is a working reservoir for power generation and irrigation‚Äîrespect any restricted access areas. Pack out all trash as facilities are minimal. Keep noise levels low to preserve the tranquil atmosphere for other visitors.

**Weather and Seasonal Preparation:** November mornings can be chilly at this elevation‚Äîbring layers. The lakeside can be breezy even when the highway feels calm. Check weather conditions before departure as mountain fog can obscure views.

**Crowd Avoidance:** Arrive before 9:00 AM to avoid tour bus traffic on the Yamanami Highway. Weekday visits will be quieter than weekends during autumn foliage season. The lake's status as a lesser-known stop means it's rarely crowded regardless of season.

**Important Notes:** This is primarily a roadside scenic stop rather than a developed tourist attraction. Facilities are minimal‚Äîrestrooms and food services available at larger stops like Handa Kogen Drive-In further up the route. The walking path is unpaved in sections; wear appropriate footwear. Mobile phone signal may be limited in this mountain area. While the 1975 earthquake damage has long since been repaired, the lake level and dam integrity have been maintained for its power generation and irrigation functions.

If time is limited, prioritize Makinoto Pass and Tadewara Wetlands over Yamashita-ko. The lake is worth stopping at if you're making good time and want a peaceful break from driving. Odanoike Pond (the adjacent natural lake) may offer more photogenic opportunities depending on vegetation and lighting conditions.
