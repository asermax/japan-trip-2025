The Chojabaru Visitor Center (é•·è€…åŽŸãƒ“ã‚¸ã‚¿ãƒ¼ã‚»ãƒ³ã‚¿ãƒ¼) serves as the primary gateway and environmental education center for Aso-Kuju National Park's northern Kuju highlands region. Situated at the base of the Kuju Mountain Range along the scenic Yamanami Highway at 1,000 meters elevation, this modern facility functions both as an information hub for the park's diverse ecosystems and as the trailhead for the internationally recognized Tadewara Wetlands. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/parks/aso-kuju/see-and-do/chojabaru-visitor-center/)

The center sits in the heart of Chojabaru plateau, a lush grassland area characterized by dramatic contrasts between delicate wetland ecosystems and the volcanic Kuju mountain range, offering commanding views of steaming Mount Io. [ðŸ”—](https://explore-kumamoto.com/chojabaru/)

**November 2025 Relevance:** Early November is excellent timing for autumn wetland colors (golden brown marsh grasses, red and yellow mountain foliage), comfortable hiking weather, and potential morning mist phenomena in the highlands.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The facility's exhibits provide essential context for the Aso-Kuju ecosystem through a 40-person capacity high-definition theater showcasing the region's four distinct seasons, large-scale satellite photographs revealing the landscape's volcanic structure, and detailed displays about local flora, fauna, and the critical role of noyaki (controlled grassland burning) in maintaining biodiversity. [ðŸ”—](https://kujufanclub.com/en/chojabaru-en/)

This thousand-year-old spring burning practice prevents forest encroachment that would otherwise eliminate the grasslands within just a few years, preserving habitat for rare grassland-dependent species. Without controlled burning, grasslands would revert to scrubland within 2-3 years and forest within a few more.

The center's direct connection to Tadewara Marsh - Oita's first Ramsar Convention site registered in 2005 - makes it more than a typical visitor center. The facility's ground floor opens directly onto a 38-hectare wetland system protected under international conservation agreements. [ðŸ”—](https://www.kanpai-japan.com/tadewara-wetlands-oita/)
