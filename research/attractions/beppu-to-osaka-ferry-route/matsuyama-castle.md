Matsuyama Castle stands as one of Japan's most architecturally significant feudal fortresses, perched atop the 132-meter Mount Katsuyama in the heart of Matsuyama City. Construction began in 1602 under feudal lord Kato Yoshiaki, who was granted the domain for his service in the pivotal Battle of Sekigahara. The castle took approximately 25 years to complete and served as a strategic stronghold throughout the Edo period (1603-1867). [🔗](https://www.matsuyamajo.jp/en/guide.html)

The castle's current three-story main keep (tenshu) was completed in 1854, making it the last original castle tower built during the Edo period - a distinction that sets it apart from all other Japanese castles. The original five-story tower was destroyed by lightning in 1784, and the replacement took 70 years to complete. This timing proved fortuitous, as the tower survived the Meiji Restoration's castle destruction orders in 1868 and World War II bombings that destroyed many other castles. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuyama_Castle_(Iyo))

Over the centuries, Matsuyama Castle was ruled by three successive clans: the Kato, Gamo, and finally the Matsudaira clan - relatives of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate - who controlled it until the end of the feudal era. The castle's roof is uniquely adorned with the Matsudaira family crest, making it the only one of the twelve original castles to feature tiles with the "Aoi Crest" of the powerful Tokugawa clan.

The castle achieved Important Cultural Property designation for its tenshu and 34 other structures in 1935, and has been protected as a National Historic Site since 1952. In 2019, an additional nine structures received designation as Registered Tangible Cultural Properties, bringing the total number of designated structures to 21 Important Cultural Properties.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Literary Heritage

Matsuyama Castle holds a special place in Japanese literature as a prominent landmark in two major works that helped establish Matsuyama's cultural identity. The castle towers over the city setting of Natsume Soseki's beloved 1906 novel "Botchan," which draws from the author's personal experience teaching at Matsuyama Middle School in 1895. The story follows a young Tokyo teacher navigating life in provincial Matsuyama during the Meiji era, and the novel remains one of Japan's most popular works, read by many students during their school years. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botchan)

The castle also inspired several haiku by Matsuyama's native son Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902), regarded as a major figure in modern haiku poetry who wrote nearly 20,000 stanzas during his short life. Among his castle-themed works are "Matsuyama castle the keep is higher than the autumn sky" and "spring breeze - the castle shows above the pines" (春風や城あらはるゝ松の上). These works helped cement the castle's place in Matsuyama's identity as the "Haiku Capital of Japan." [🔗](https://internetpoem.com/masaoka-shiki/matsuyama-castle-poem/)

### Architectural Significance & The 21 Cultural Properties

Matsuyama Castle exemplifies the sophisticated "flatland-mountain" (hirayamashiro) castle design, built strategically across an entire mountain with three main defensive enclosures: the Honmaru (main enclosure) at the summit, and the Ninomaru (secondary) and Sannomaru (tertiary) enclosures at the base. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuyama_Castle_(Iyo))

The castle showcases a rare "Renritsu-style" (multi-tower) design where the main keep is connected to smaller turrets via corridors, creating a complex and formidable structure unlike most Japanese castles. This interconnected system of towers allowed defenders to move between defensive positions under cover while maintaining overlapping fields of fire. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/819/)

The castle's defensive systems represent peak Edo-period military architecture with stone walls reaching 17 meters in height, climbing stone walls along mountain slopes, three masugata-style gates, hidden gates, archer openings and stone-drop slots, and surrounding water moats and earthworks. The castle features wooden walls finished with black-colored lacquer on the first and second floors, with white plaster on the third floor. [🔗](https://www.matsuyamajo.jp/en/guide.html)
