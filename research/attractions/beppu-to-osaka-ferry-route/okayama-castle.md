Okayama Castle (*Okayama-jō*) earned its famous nickname *U-jō* (烏城, "Crow Castle") due to its striking black-lacquered exterior walls covered with black clapboards. This dramatic appearance was a deliberate architectural choice, likely intended to contrast with the brilliant white of nearby Himeji Castle ("White Egret Castle"). Built in the classic Azuchi-Momoyama style, the black castle became a powerful symbol of feudal authority in the Chugoku region and now serves as an integrated cultural experience with the adjacent Korakuen Garden.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Before the decisive Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the castle's roof tiles were gilded gold, earning it an even more magnificent nickname: "Golden Crow Castle" (*Kin U-jō*). The current reconstruction, completed in 1966 and renovated again in 2022, features golden *shachihoko* (mythical fish-shaped roof ornaments) in homage to this gilded history.

Construction began in 1573 under Ukita Naoie but was not completed until 1597 by his son Hideie. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the Ikeda clan took control in 1603 as relatives of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Ikeda family ruled for 12 generations until the Meiji Period, overseeing significant advancements in local production, education, arts, and the creation of the magnificent Korakuen Garden. This integrated planning makes the castle and garden inseparable cultural experiences. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayama_Castle) [🔗](https://jcastle.info/view/Okayama_Castle)

The castle's relationship with Korakuen Garden exemplifies the Japanese aesthetic principle of *shakkei* (borrowed scenery), where the black castle tower becomes an integral element in the garden's landscape composition, creating extended vistas that connect both attractions visually and conceptually.
