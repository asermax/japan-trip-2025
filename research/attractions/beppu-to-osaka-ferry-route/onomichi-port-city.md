Onomichi is a quaint historic port city that extends from the mainland across the Seto Inland Sea. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3475.html) The city's port opened in 1168 and for the next 500 years served as a rice shipment center and port for all trades with foreign countries, developing as the largest port city in the Seto Inland Sea during the Middle Ages.

Today, Onomichi's main selling point is nostalgia, with streets that criss-cross the steep hillside that rises almost immediately from the seafront.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The city became more famous during the 1980s and 1990s thanks to director Nobuhiko Obayashi's movies, particularly his "Onomichi Trilogy," and the city was also the setting for Yasujiro Ozu's masterpiece "Tokyo Story" (1953).
