Ozu City, often called the "Little Kyoto of Iyo," is a historic castle town in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku, approximately 25km inland from Yawatahama Port. The city flourished during the Edo Period (1603-1868) as a center of commerce along the Hijikawa River, with wealth generated from paper, silk, and vegetable wax trade. Today, Ozu stands as one of Japan's best-preserved castle towns, featuring authentically reconstructed wooden castle architecture and a designated National Important Cultural Property villa.

Ozu serves as the perfect cultural gateway to Shikoku for travelers arriving from the Yawatahama ferry. While Yawatahama is the physical entry point from Kyushu, Ozu provides the first immersive experience of Shikoku's feudal history and traditional atmosphere, setting the tone for exploring the island known for its pilgrimage routes, castles, and rural charm.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Ozu emerged as a strategic castle town during the feudal era, with its first defensive structures dating back to the early 14th century. The town's prosperity was built on the Hijikawa River, which served as the primary transportation route for regional products including paper, silk, and vegetable wax (a key component for candles during the Edo Period). This wealth is reflected in the sophisticated architecture of samurai residences, merchant houses, and temples that have been preserved throughout the historic district.

**Ozu Castle: Authentic Wooden Reconstruction**

Ozu Castle stands as one of the most significant castle reconstructions in modern Japan. Unlike the vast majority of 20th-century castle rebuilds that used steel-reinforced concrete, Ozu Castle's main keep was authentically reconstructed in 2004 using traditional wooden construction methods. The original keep was demolished in 1888 due to deterioration, but after a decade-long community effort costing 1.6 billion JPY, it was rebuilt based on old photographs, maps, and a discovered model depicting the original structure. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ÅŒzu_Castle)

Specialist architects and craftsmen recreated the structure using timber, bamboo, plaster, tile, and mud, employing traditional joinery techniques without modern materials. This makes Ozu Castle one of the few places in Japan where visitors can experience a castle keep as it would have been during the Edo Period. Four turrets (Koran, Daidokoro, Owata, and Minami Sumi) were designated as Important Cultural Properties in 1957 and survived from the original castle complex.

**Garyu Sanso Villa: Architectural Masterpiece**

Garyu Sanso is a National Important Cultural Property and one of Japan's finest examples of sukiya-zukuri architecture. Built between the Meiji and Taisho eras (around 1907) by a wealthy local merchant, the villa took ten years to design based on references from famous imperial villas in Kyoto such as Katsura Rikyu and Shugakuin Rikyu, and four years with 9,000 artisans to construct.

The name "Garyu" means "reclining dragon," as the hill it's built on is said to resemble one. The villa features two main buildings: Garyu-in (the main thatched-roof house) and Furo-an Pavilion, which slightly overhangs the Hiji River on stilts. Each room showcases exceptional craftsmanship with intricately carved transoms, elegantly made lattices, unevenly sized tatami mats, and aesthetically pleasing alcoves. The custom-designed moon-shaped window and use of different woods and bamboo demonstrate the pinnacle of Japanese aesthetic principles and wabi-sabi philosophy. Garyu Sanso has received one star from the Michelin Green Guide Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://en.japantravel.com/ehime/garyu-sanso-an-architectural-masterpiece-in-harmony-with-nature/71342)
