Tatara Shimanami Park is the largest and most significant rest area along the iconic Shimanami Kaido route, positioned just off the Omishima Interchange on Omishima Island in the Seto Inland Sea. This roadside station (michi-no-eki) serves as both a practical service area for travelers and a cultural landmark celebrating the engineering marvel of the Tatara Bridge and the cycling culture that has made the Shimanami Kaido world-famous.

The park's defining feature is its spectacular panoramic view of the Tatara Bridge, one of the world's leading cable-stayed bridges. When completed in 1999, the Tatara Bridge held the distinction of being the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, with a center span of 890 meters (2,920 feet) and steel towers reaching 220 meters (722 feet) high shaped like inverted Ys. The bridge maintained this record until 2008 and currently ranks as the world's 4th longest cable-stayed bridge. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatara_Bridge)

The site is particularly significant as the home of the "Cyclist Sanctuary" monument, built to commemorate the first Cycling Shimanami international cycling race held in October 2014. The monument has become a beloved pilgrimage site for cyclists from across Japan and around the world, symbolizing a bridge leading the Islands of Setouchi to the future.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**Tatara Bridge Engineering Marvel:**

The Tatara Bridge represents a pinnacle of Japanese bridge engineering. Construction took over six years and was accomplished without any accidents, employing numerous technological advancements. The bridge's distinctive inverted Y-shaped towers resemble "two swans spreading their wings" and have become an iconic symbol of the Shimanami Kaido route. When it opened in 1999, it surpassed the Normandie Bridge in France to become the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, holding this record until 2008.

**Cyclist Sanctuary Cultural Significance:**

The park earned its designation as a "Cyclist Sanctuary" through a sister cycling road agreement between the Setouchi Shimanami Kaido and Taiwan's Sun Moon Lake Cycling Course. The monument commemorates not only the 2014 international cycling race but the broader recognition of the Shimanami Kaido as one of the world's premier cycling routes. Cyclists from around the globe make pilgrimages to this monument to capture commemorative photos symbolizing their completion of this legendary route.

The island represents the agricultural and cultural heart of the Shimanami Kaido, making Tatara Shimanami Park an ideal rest stop to experience both engineering excellence and local island culture.
