*Bansuiso's French Neo-Renaissance facade in Matsuyama*

Bansuiso Villa stands as an extraordinary architectural monument to Japan's early 20th-century embrace of Western culture. Built in 1922 by Count Hisamatsu Sadakoto, a descendant of Matsuyama's feudal lords, this French Neo-Renaissance ch√¢teau represents the pinnacle of Taisho-era cultural exchange between Japan and France. [üîó](https://www.bansuisou.org/en/)

Count Sadakoto's deep connection to France was forged during 15 years of residency there, where he graduated from the prestigious Saint-Cyr Military Academy and served as a military attach√© in Paris. This extended immersion in French culture and aesthetics culminated in his vision to bring European architectural grandeur to Japan. Designed by architect Shichir≈ç Giko, the villa showcases elegant lines, ornate decorations, and a stately presence that would be at home on the boulevards of Paris.

The building holds the distinction of being the oldest reinforced concrete structure in Ehime Prefecture, demonstrating the adoption of modern Western construction techniques in Japan. While European in style, the design subtly incorporates Japanese aesthetic principles, including deliberate asymmetry that contrasts with the perfect symmetry typical of formal European Renaissance architecture. [üîó](https://www.bansuisou.org/en/)

Upon completion, Bansuiso quickly became Matsuyama's premier social hub, hosting the nation's elite, intellectuals, and even members of the Imperial family. The then-Crown Prince Hirohito (later Emperor Showa) visited the villa, and in 1953, Emperor Showa stayed at Bansuiso with Empress Nagako during the National Sports Festival in Shikoku.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

In November 2011, Bansuiso received designation as a National Important Cultural Property, recognizing its historical and architectural significance. Remarkably, it survived World War II air raids that destroyed much of Matsuyama, leaving it as a rare and authentic example of Taisho-era Western architecture. [üîó](https://www.bansuisou.org/en/)

The site holds additional literary significance‚Äîit was once occupied by an inn where the celebrated novelist Natsume Soseki (author of "Botchan") stayed in 1895, connecting the villa to Matsuyama's rich literary tradition alongside haiku master Masaoka Shiki.

The villa epitomizes Japan's Taisho era (1912-1926) cultural exchange with Europe, symbolizing the cosmopolitan aspirations of early 20th-century Japan. Count Sadakoto's 15-year French residency and military academy education significantly enhances appreciation for the architectural details and cultural fusion embodied in the villa's design.

## The Experience

**Exterior Architecture:**

The villa's French Neo-Renaissance facade captivates with Corinthian columns at the entrance, a steep natural slate roof topped with copper plating, and stunning stained glass windows. Legend holds that gold coins were once melted into the lightning rod. The building's deliberate asymmetry represents a subtle fusion of European formality with Japanese aesthetic sensibilities.

**First Floor (Free Entry):**

The grand entrance hall features an impressive wooden staircase crafted from teak, crystal chandeliers, ornate moldings, and masterful stained glass windows by Shintaro Kiuchi, one of Japan's leading stained glass artisans of the era. The unified color scheme contrasts dark brown teak with white plaster, creating a profound and stately atmosphere. Decorative fireplaces and Art Nouveau elements throughout showcase the era's finest craftsmanship. [üîó](https://www.bansuisou.org/en/1st_floor.html)

**Second Floor Exhibition Space (¬•300):**

The Geihinshitsu (main reception room) offers a unique visual experience where the ship depicted in the stained glass appears to float before viewers seated on the period couches. Two imperial portraits hang in the reception room: the left showing Prince-Regent Hirohito at age 21, the right depicting Emperor Showa at seventy. [üîó](https://bansuisou.org/en/2nd_floor.html)

**Haiku Hall of Fame:**

Reflecting Matsuyama's significance as the home of haiku master Masaoka Shiki and the setting for Natsume Soseki's "Botchan," the second floor houses Japan's only comprehensive Haiku Hall of Fame. Two dedicated rooms exhibit haiku magazines from approximately 200 major haiku societies and associations, along with representative poems on autograph cardboards, celebrating the nation's rich haiku heritage.

**Gardens and Grounds:**

The villa sits within beautifully maintained gardens at the foot of Shiroyama (Castle Mountain), creating a striking contrast between the feudal fortress above and the European ch√¢teau below. The grounds are free to explore and offer excellent photography opportunities.
