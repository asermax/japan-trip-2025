The Shimanami Kaido (Nishiseto Expressway) represents one of Japan's most spectacular engineering achievements and scenic driving routes. Completed in 1999, this 70-kilometer expressway physically and economically linked the previously isolated communities of the Seto Inland Sea islands with mainland Honshu and Shikoku, transforming logistics and daily life across the region.

The route consists of nine bridges connecting six islands - Mukaishima, Innoshima, Ikuchijima, Omishima, Hakatajima, and Oshima - each bridge an engineering marvel in its own right. The Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge stands as the world's first triple suspension bridge with a total length of 4 kilometers, while the Tatara Bridge was the world's longest cable-stayed bridge when completed. This collection of unique, record-breaking structures makes the route a showcase of modern Japanese bridge engineering.

While famous worldwide as a "cyclist's holy land," the route offers drivers a comfortable, climate-controlled way to experience the grand scale of the bridges and dramatic island landscapes. The expressway features dedicated cycling paths alongside vehicle lanes, and numerous roadside stations provide facilities accessible to both cyclists and drivers.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Historically, these islands were crucial for trade and transportation, linking the two main islands for centuries. The ancient "Shimanami Route" was used by travelers and merchants, and during the Sengoku period, the area was home to the Murakami Kaizoku - powerful naval clans who ruled the Seto Inland Sea.

**Engineering Achievement:**

The Nishiseto Expressway opened on May 1, 1999, spanning 59.4 kilometers (36.9 miles) with four lanes and a separated path for pedestrians and cyclists. The route connects Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture on Honshu with Imabari in Ehime Prefecture on Shikoku. This collection of bridges represents numerous technological advancements:

- **Tatara Bridge:** Center span of 890 meters, world's longest cable-stayed bridge 1999-2008
- **Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge:** World's first triple suspension bridge, 4 kilometers total length
- **Construction Achievement:** Multiple bridges completed without major accidents, setting engineering records

**Cycling Culture:**

The Shimanami Kaido has earned recognition as one of the world's premier cycling routes, with a sister cycling road agreement with Taiwan's Sun Moon Lake Cycling Course. The "Cyclist Sanctuary" monument at Tatara Shimanami Park symbolizes this cultural significance. Thousands of cyclists traverse the route annually, making it a pilgrimage site for cycling enthusiasts worldwide. [ðŸ”—](https://www.skr.mlit.go.jp/kikaku/88-kei/en/scenery/58_ehime.html)

- Be aware of "half interchanges" (one-direction access only)
- Most scenic routes are local island roads closer to water
- Bridges have separated cycling infrastructure
- Exercise caution sharing roads with cyclists on island sections
- ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) recommended for smooth passage

**Route Integration:**
This 70km crossing transforms the journey from "Shikoku exploration" to "return to Honshu mainland," marking a significant geographic transition. After Matsuyama cultural immersion, the island-hopping route provides engineering marvels, coastal scenery, and island culture before continuing toward Osaka. Logical stop sequence: Tatara Shimanami Park (Omishima) â†’ Kirosan Observatory (Oshima) â†’ Onomichi arrival.

**Cultural Etiquette:**
- Remember this is Japan's most famous cycling route
- Drive defensively and share roads courteously with cyclists
- Particularly heavy cyclist traffic on weekends and holidays
- Most cyclists during November (peak season through late November)
- Do not photograph while driving - use designated parking areas
