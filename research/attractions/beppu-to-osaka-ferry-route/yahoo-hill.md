Yahoo Hill (ヤッホー坂/ヒャッホー坂), also known as "Lightning Bolt Hill" or "Inazuma Road" (Thunderbolt Road), is one of the Shimanami Kaido's most iconic cycling and driving spots, featuring a distinctive S-curved winding road that appears to lead directly into the Seto Inland Sea.

The name derives from the irresistible urge cyclists and motorcyclists feel to shout "Yahoo!" or "Hyahho!" as they experience the exhilarating descent down this dramatic S-curved coastal road. [🔗](https://visitshimanami.com/area-guides/omishima/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Located along Ehime Prefectural Route 51 (the Omishima Loop Road) in the Munakata area on the southwestern coast of Omishima, the hill is also known as "Munakata Coast Inazuma Road" (宗方海岸イナズマロード), referencing its lightning bolt-like S-curve shape when viewed from above.

The road gained additional cultural recognition through its appearance in the 2018 Japanese film "嘘を愛する女" (The Woman Who Loved Lies, also known as "The Lies She Loved") starring Masami Nagasawa and Issei Takahashi, bringing wider attention to this already beloved local landmark.

The hill represents the joyful experience of cycling the Shimanami Kaido and is part of a world-renowned cycling route that draws international visitors. The Shimanami Kaido represents significant infrastructure investment in cycling tourism, and Omishima Island takes pride in its role as a highlight of this famous route.

## Visiting Information

**Access:** From Matsuyama via Shimanami Kaido, take Route 317 (Shimanami Kaido Expressway) north from Imabari, exit at Omishima IC, then follow Route 51 (Omishima Loop Road) south and west along the coast to the Munakata area—approximately 25 minutes from the IC.

The S-curve is located on Route 51 between the Toyo Ito Museum of Architecture and the western coastal section. Look for the distinctive downhill winding road with sea views directly ahead.

**Route Context:** Located on the "rollercoaster" southern section of Omishima, where undulating terrain contrasts dramatically with the flatter eastern and northern coasts. The road stretches just over 1 kilometer and features a distinctive downhill section where the pavement appears to continue straight into the azure waters of the Seto Inland Sea.

**Seasonal Considerations:** November is considered peak cycling season on the Shimanami Kaido, offering the best chance for clear blue skies with mild temperatures around 17-18°C. [🔗](https://shimanami-cycle.or.jp/go-shimanami/experience/618/) Autumn foliage adds beautiful color contrasts, with the coastal scenery enhanced by the season's golden light.

**November 3 (Culture Day) Considerations:** National holiday typically increases traffic on popular routes. Yahoo Hill may see higher volumes of cyclists and tourists enjoying the long weekend. Early morning or late afternoon visits recommended to avoid peak crowds.

## The Experience

### The Driving Experience

For car travelers, Yahoo Hill offers a brief but memorable scenic moment along the Omishima loop. The winding descent provides spectacular coastal panoramas, with the road's distinctive S-curve creating a sense of drama as you navigate the turns with the Seto Inland Sea stretching out before you.

Unlike cyclists who experience the full rush of the descent, drivers navigate the curves more cautiously, but the visual impact remains powerful—the illusion of the road disappearing into the ocean creates a memorable "edge of the world" feeling that has made this location famous among both cyclists and driving enthusiasts.

### Photography Opportunities

Yahoo Hill is one of the most photographed locations on the Shimanami Kaido route. The classic shot is taken from the top of the hill looking down at the S-curves with the Seto Inland Sea as a backdrop—the perspective makes it appear as though the road leads directly into the water.

**Photography Tips:**
- **Best angles:** From the top of the hill looking down the curves toward the sea; wide-angle lens recommended
- **Obstacles:** A telephone pole can obstruct some compositions—position yourself to minimize its visual impact
- **Lighting:** Golden hour (early morning or late afternoon) provides the most dramatic light
- **Seasonal context:** November offers excellent visibility with clear autumn skies and beautiful coastal colors [🔗](https://cycling-ehime.com/en/routes/shimanami-kaido-omishima-loop/)
