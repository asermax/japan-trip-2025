Tomo-no-ura (ÈûÜ„ÅÆÊµ¶) is a historic port town in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, that served as the primary inspiration for Studio Ghibli's 2008 film "Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea." This charming fishing village, designated as a National Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings (2017), preserves one of Japan's most authentic Edo-period maritime townscapes. The town's strategic location at the meeting point of eastward and westward tidal currents in the Seto Inland Sea made it an essential "waiting-for-the-tide" port during the Edo period (1603-1868), where ships would anchor to wait for favorable tides before continuing their journey. [üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomonoura)

Tomo-no-ura represents a rare surviving example of an Edo-period "shiomachi-no-minato" (waiting-for-the-tide port), where the town's circular harbor provided safe anchorage for vessels navigating the complex tidal currents of the Seto Inland Sea. During the height of its prosperity in the Edo period, the port hosted the famous kitamae-bune cargo ships traveling between Osaka and Hokkaido, transforming the town into a bustling center of commerce, information exchange, and cultural interaction.

The town gained international recognition when director Hayao Miyazaki stayed here for two months in 2004-2005, living in a house overlooking the harbor while developing the visual world of "Ponyo." He personally contributed to the restoration of a local historic building, the Onfunayado Iroha, demonstrating his deep connection to the town's preservation.

The 8.6-hectare preservation district protects a dense concentration of traditional structures, including the iconic Joyato Lighthouse (built 1859), the Ota Family Residence with its homeishu medicinal liquor storehouses, and Fukuzen-ji Temple's Taichoro pavilion, which offers views once proclaimed by Korean envoys as "the most beautiful scenery in East Asia."

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Edo Period Maritime Heritage

Tomo-no-ura's strategic location at the convergence of tidal currents made it an indispensable waypoint for maritime trade during the Edo period. The circular harbor provided safe anchorage for vessels waiting for favorable tides to continue their journey through the Seto Inland Sea. This "waiting-for-the-tide" function transformed the town into a bustling commercial hub where kitamae-bune cargo ships traveling between Osaka and Hokkaido would rest, creating a vibrant center for commerce, information exchange, and cultural interaction. [üîó](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3432.html)

### Studio Ghibli's Ponyo Connection

Director Hayao Miyazaki's two-month residence in Tomo-no-ura during 2004-2005 fundamentally shaped the visual world of "Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea." Living in a house overlooking the harbor, Miyazaki absorbed the town's distinctive bay shape, winding alleys lined with rustic wooden-facade houses, and waterfront character, all of which appear throughout the 2008 animated film. His personal contribution to restoring the historic Onfunayado Iroha building demonstrates his deep connection to the town's preservation efforts.

### Architectural Preservation

Designated as a National Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings in 2017, the 8.6-hectare area protects a remarkable concentration of Edo-period port infrastructure. The preservation includes the Joyato Lighthouse (1859)‚Äîthe largest stone lighthouse from the Edo period standing 11 meters tall‚Äîstone gangi staircases leading to the water, traditional hato breakwaters, and the funabansho (old coast guard station). Narrow machiya townhouses with lattice windows, historic port facilities, and the waterfront district create an authentic atmosphere of maritime heritage rarely found in modern Japan.

## The Experience

### Fukuzen-ji Temple & Taichoro Pavilion

The temple's reception hall, built around 1690 for foreign diplomats, offers the town's most celebrated view across the bay to Benten-jima Island with its small pagoda and larger Sensui-jima Island beyond. Korean envoy Lee Bang Eun proclaimed this vista "the most beautiful scenery in East Asia" in 1711. The tatami-matted viewing room (¬•200 admission) provides a serene space to contemplate the same panoramic Seto Inland Sea landscape that has inspired poets and artists for centuries.

### Io-ji Temple

Founded by Kukai (Kobo Daishi) in 826, this Shingon Buddhist temple occupies a hillside location with spectacular views of Tomonoura and the Seto Inland Sea archipelago. A 15-minute ascent up the hill behind the main temple building leads to the Taishiden hall, offering even more expansive vistas. The nostalgic stone and earthen walls with tiled roofs, combined with the elevated perspective of the bay, make this an essential stop for photography and panoramic views.

### Historic Harbor District & Joyato Lighthouse

The waterfront area preserves remarkable Edo-period port infrastructure, including stone gangi staircases leading to the water, traditional hato breakwaters, and the funabansho (old coast guard station). The Joyato Lighthouse, standing 11 meters tall, is the largest stone lighthouse from the Edo period and serves as the town's iconic symbol. Built in 1859, it continues to guide vessels in and out of the circular harbor. The bayfront is dotted with small fishing boats demonstrating the port's continuing maritime relevance.
