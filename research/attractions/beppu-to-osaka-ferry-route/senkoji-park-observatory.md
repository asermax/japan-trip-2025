Senko-ji Temple stands as Onomichi's most iconic landmark, its vermilion-painted structures perched dramatically near the summit of Mount Senkoji (144.2 meters) with commanding views over the Onomichi Channel and the island-dotted Seto Inland Sea. Founded by the legendary monk Kobo Daishi in 806 AD during the Daidō era, this temple has witnessed over 1,200 years of Japanese history and serves as the 10th site of the prestigious Chugoku 33 Kannon Pilgrimage.

The temple complex showcases remarkable architectural features, most notably the vermilion-painted main hall (Hondo) reconstructed in 1686 with its unusual elevated stage structure—earning it the nickname "Red Hall" (Akadō). Built among massive rock outcroppings, the temple's most dramatic natural feature is the 15-meter-high Tama no Iwa (Jewel Rock), topped with a sphere carved from the living rock. According to legend, this rock once glowed at night, illuminating the surrounding sea and guiding mariners safely to port.

In March 2022, the park unveiled a new observation deck nicknamed "PEAK" at the summit, featuring modern, stylish design with gentle curves that frame spectacular panoramas. From this vantage point 140 meters above sea level, visitors can see the retro townscape of Onomichi spread below, the Onomichi Channel threading through the city, the islands of the Seto Inland Sea stretching to the horizon, and—for route travelers—the impressive engineering of the Shimanami Kaido bridges marking the journey just completed.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The temple's bell tower has been designated one of Japan's "100 Soundscapes to be Preserved," its resonant tones marking the passage of time over the city below. [🔗](https://dive-hiroshima.com/en/explore/1503/) Adjacent to the temple grounds, the Literary Path (Bungaku no Komichi) honors Onomichi's rich literary heritage with 25 stone monuments featuring passages from works by authors connected to the city, including the acclaimed novelist Shiga Naoya, poet Fumiko Hayashi, and the legendary haiku master Basho. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senk%C5%8D-ji_(Onomichi))

Senkoji Park has earned designation as one of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots, with approximately 1,500 cherry trees transforming the hillside into clouds of pink and white during late March and early April. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/90011-sak1307087/) During cherry blossom season, special evening illuminations extend for a month (mid-March to mid-April), creating magical night viewing opportunities. The park also shines during autumn foliage season (November), when maple trees add brilliant reds and golds to the panoramic views. [🔗](https://kosublog.com/en/onomichi-part2-1603/)
