Ishite-ji (石手寺), meaning "Stone Hand Temple," is a Shingon Buddhist temple founded around 670 AD and is the 51st temple on the Shikoku 88-temple pilgrimage route. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5503.html) The temple has been awarded one star by the Michelin Green Guide Japan and boasts the largest collection of cultural assets of any of the Shikoku pilgrimage temples, with seven structures designated as National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties. [🔗](https://en.matsuyama-sightseeing.com/spot/31-2/)

The temple's most distinguished structure is its Niomon Gate, a National Treasure built in 1318 during the Kamakura Period. The gate stands 7 meters high and 4 meters wide with a 3-meter-wide entry space. The Niō guardian statues within the gate date from 1240. At either side of the gate hang two giant straw sandals (waraji), and according to legend, if you are suffering from leg ailments and touch these sandals, you will be cured.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Legend of Emon Saburō and the Founding

The temple's name and founding legend are deeply intertwined with the origin story of the Shikoku pilgrimage itself. According to legend, Emon Saburō, the richest and cruelest landlord in Shikoku, lived near Matsuyama in the early 9th century. When a beggar-priest appeared at his gate seeking alms for three consecutive days, Saburō drove him away with curses, and on the third day broke the pilgrim's begging bowl with a broom. The bowl shattered into eight fragments, and thereafter Saburō's eight children fell ill and died, one after another. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emon_Sabur%C5%8D)

Realizing that Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism) was the affronted pilgrim, Saburō set out to seek forgiveness. He traveled the pilgrimage route clockwise twenty times in vain, then undertook the route in reverse until he finally collapsed exhausted. On his deathbed, Kūkai appeared to grant absolution. Emon requested to be reborn into a wealthy family in Matsuyama so he might restore a neglected temple. As he died, he clasped a stone in his hand. [🔗](https://shikokutours.com/attractions/people-of-shikoku/emon-saburo)

Shortly afterward, a baby named Kōno Yasukata was born with his hand grasped tightly around a stone inscribed "Emon Saburō is reborn." He grew up to be a generous person who used his wealth to restore the dilapidated temple Anyō-ji, which was then renamed Ishite-ji ("Stone Hand Temple"). The Jewel Stone from this legend resides in the temple's Treasure Museum and is considered the origin of the Shikoku Pilgrimage tradition. [🔗](https://88shikokuhenro.jp/en/kumanozan-kokuzoin-ishiteji/)

This legend established several important pilgrimage traditions: it suggests the origin of doing the pilgrimage in reverse, it created the tradition of leaving name slips (fuda) at each temple, and it encourages the custom of giving osettai (alms) to pilgrims.

### Historical Significance

Most of the temple's buildings were burned by Chōsokabe Motochika in 1566, but the main hall (Hondō), Niō Gate, and three-storied pagoda survived. The surviving structures exhibit the typical architecture of the Kamakura Period (1192-1333). [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishite-ji) The three-storied pagoda stands 24.1 meters high in the center of the temple grounds. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/matsuyama/temples-shrines/ishite-ji)

The temple houses six Important Cultural Properties: the Hondō (main hall), the Kariteimotendo (goddess hall for safe childbirth), the Gomado (fire ritual hall), the three-storied pagoda, the bell tower with the oldest bronze bell in Ehime Prefecture, and a five-ring pagoda.

## The Experience

### Main Temple Complex

Explore the spacious grounds featuring the Hondō (main hall), three-storied pagoda (24.1m high), bell tower with Ehime's oldest bronze bell, and various smaller halls including the Kariteimotendo (goddess of safe childbirth). All surviving buildings showcase the elegant architectural style of the Kamakura Period, having survived the 1566 fire. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/matsuyama/temples-shrines/ishite-ji)

### Treasure Museum

View approximately 100 items on permanent display, including the famous Jewel Stone from the legend of Emon Saburō, considered the origin of the Shikoku Pilgrimage tradition. The museum houses the largest collection of cultural assets among all 88 pilgrimage temples. [🔗](https://88shikokuhenro.jp/en/kumanozan-kokuzoin-ishiteji/)

### Mantra Cave Experience

Venture through the dimly lit, approximately 200-meter-long man-made cave tunnel filled with countless Jizo statues, Buddhist carvings, and religious drawings. The cave branches in two directions and creates an eerie, mysterious atmosphere. Bring or use your cell phone light as there is minimal illumination. This unique feature sets Ishite-ji apart from most pilgrimage temples. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5503.html)

### Okuno-in (Inner Temple)

After emerging from the cave, cross the street to discover the unusual inner temple complex featuring a large golden dome-shaped hall that resembles a giant bead. The hall contains an eclectic collection of sculptures, carvings, and paintings, including striking images of the emaciated Buddha before his enlightenment. The grounds have a somewhat unkempt, surreal quality that contrasts sharply with the main temple. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/ehime/okuno-in-at-ishite-ji/4003)

### Kūkai Statue

On the hillside northeast of the temple, view the huge statue of Kūkai (Kōbō Daishi) holding a brush. His head faces India where Buddhism originated, while his body faces China where he studied esoteric Buddhism - a symbolic representation of his role in bringing Buddhism to Japan. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/ehime/the-strange-and-beautiful-temple-no-51-ishiteji/16)

### Pilgrimage Rituals

Observe or participate in traditional henro (pilgrimage) practices. Watch pilgrims in white clothing and conical hats performing prayers, lighting candles and incense, and receiving goshuin (temple stamps). Non-pilgrims are welcome to receive stamps (¥300-500 donation) but should pray first and remember that worship, not stamp collecting, is the primary purpose.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### November 3, 2025 (Culture Day) Considerations

Culture Day (Bunka no Hi) is a national holiday celebrating Japanese culture, arts, and academic achievement. While specific events at Ishite-ji Temple are not documented, typical Culture Day temple activities include special ceremonies, cultural demonstrations, and increased visitor numbers. Given Ishite-ji's cultural significance as a National Treasure site, there may be commemorative activities or increased ceremonial observations. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_Day)

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Weather: Mild temperatures around 17-18°C with 50-60% sunny days [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/weather/shikoku/matsuyama/)
- Autumn Colors: Temple grounds may feature developing autumn foliage in early November
- Lighting: Early November moderate daylight; bring flashlight or ensure phone battery is charged for cave exploration
- Crowds: National holiday means increased domestic tourism; arrive early (7-8 AM) to experience the temple before peak crowds

**Photography Conditions:**
- Morning light illuminates the Niomon Gate from the east (7-9 AM)
- Cave tunnel requires phone lights or flashlights
- Golden inner temple dome photographs well in afternoon light
- Unauthorized photography strictly prohibited inside temple halls; always check posted signage [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294232-i525-k10184865-Taking_photos_inside_temples_shrines-Japan.html)

**Recommended Timing:** Ideal as part of Matsuyama cultural circuit combining Dogo Onsen, Ishite-ji Temple, and Matsuyama Castle. Visit either early morning before Dogo Onsen bathing, or late morning after breakfast in the onsen district.

### Temple Etiquette for Non-Pilgrims
