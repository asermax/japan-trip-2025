*Fukuyama Castle's distinctive white main keep, reconstructed in 1966 and renovated in 2022 to restore its unique iron-plated north side*

Fukuyama Castle stands as a remarkable testament to early Edo period military architecture and strategic positioning. Construction began in 1619 by Mizuno Katsunari, a cousin of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, and was completed in 1622. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuyama_Castle) As one of the last new castles built in the early Edo Period, it served as a critical base to protect western Japan and represented a significant exception to the shogunate's "one domain - one castle" rule. [ðŸ”—](https://fukuyamacastle.com/en/history/)

The castle's strategic importance cannot be overstatedâ€”Mizuno Katsunari was the first of the Tokugawa hereditary vassels (fudai daimyo) to be stationed in the Chugoku region, positioned strategically between the non-hereditary vassals (tozama daimyo) in Hiroshima and Okayama. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuyama_Castle) The castle was intentionally built large to both impress and intimidate the tozama daimyo, establishing Tokugawa authority in the region.

What makes Fukuyama Castle architecturally unique is its iron platingâ€”it is the only castle in Japan with protective iron plates on one side. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3433.html) The iron plating was added to the north side, the most vulnerable approach with no moat protection, to defend against bullets and bombs. [ðŸ”—](https://sustainable.japantimes.com/satoyama/14) When viewed from the northwest, the striking contrast of three white sides and one black iron-plated side creates a visually distinctive appearance.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The castle prospered throughout the Edo period under several ruling families. In 1710, Lord Abe Masakuni was awarded Fukuyama Domain, and the Abe clan ruled until the Meiji Restoration of 1868. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuyama_Castle) The domain flourished economically, issuing its own hansatsu currency and encouraging the production and distribution of Bingo tatami mats. [ðŸ”—](https://fukuyamacastle.com/en/history/) The Abe clan produced the famous late Edo period Roju (Prime Minister) Abe Masahiro, giving Fukuyama Domain significant political influence.

At the end of World War II in 1945, the castle tower and many buildings were destroyed in air raids. However, two structures survived: the Fushimi Yagura turret and Sujigane-Gomon gate, both designated National Important Cultural Properties in 1950. [ðŸ”—](https://fukuyamajo.jp/en/en_miru/en_fushimiyagura/) The main keep was rebuilt in 1966, and the grounds were designated a National Historic Site in 1964. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuyama_Castle)

The Fushimi Yagura holds particular historical significanceâ€”it was relocated from Fushimi Castle in Kyoto by the second Tokugawa Shogun Hidetada upon Fukuyama Castle's construction. [ðŸ”—](https://www.pref.hiroshima.lg.jp/soshiki_file/tatemonogatari/en/page020.html) This three-tiered, three-story white-walled turret evokes the spirit of the Momoyama Period and is the only existing building in Japan where relocation from Fushimi Castle has been proven by both literature and physical inscriptions.
