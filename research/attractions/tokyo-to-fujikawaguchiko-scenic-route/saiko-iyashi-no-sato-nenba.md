Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba stands as a poignant testament to Japanese cultural preservation and resilience. The original village of Nenba, once reverently known as "the most beautiful village in Japan," thrived for centuries as a farming community famous for its picturesque Kabuto-zukuri thatched-roof houses. In September 1966, Typhoon Ida brought devastating landslides that completely destroyed the village, wiping out 37 of its 41 traditional houses and claiming lives.

Four decades later, in 2006, the village was meticulously reconstructed with 20 authentic thatched-roof houses using traditional local techniques. The reconstruction aimed to revive the beautiful scenery lost to disaster while creating a living tourism exchange center highlighting local history, culture, and natural environment.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Each building serves specific purposes as workshops, museums, galleries, restaurants, or souvenir shops, creating an immersive cultural experience rather than a static museum. The Kabuto-zukuri architectural style, characterized by roofs shaped like samurai helmets, was historically used for sericulture (silk farming), with upper floors providing well-ventilated spaces for raising silkworms.

The village represents both cultural preservation and memorial significance, honoring the memory of the original community while maintaining traditional Japanese village life for future generations. UNESCO recognition of Mount Fuji includes cultural landscapes like this, demonstrating the interconnection between human culture and sacred natural environments.
