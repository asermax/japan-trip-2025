Oshino Hakkai represents one of Japan's most spiritually significant water sites, comprising eight sacred spring-fed ponds located in traditional Oshino village between Lake Kawaguchiko and Lake Yamanakako. Part of Mount Fuji UNESCO World Heritage Site, the ponds are fed by snowmelt filtered through porous lava layers for over 80 years underground, creating remarkably pure spring water revered for centuries.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Each pond carries deep spiritual significance, originally known as "Fujisan Nemoto Hachiko Reijo" (Eight Sacred Lakes at the Base of Mount Fuji), with each dedicated to Buddhism's eight dragon kings. The layout mirrors the Big Dipper constellation alignment. Historically, pilgrims performed purification rituals called "suigyo" before Mount Fuji ascent during Edo period.
