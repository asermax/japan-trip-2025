## Cultural & Religious Significance

As part of the extensive Sengen shrine network, Arakura Fuji Sengen Shrine holds special significance in Mount Fuji worship traditions. The shrine primarily enshrines Konohanasakuya-hime, the Shinto goddess associated with Mount Fuji, providing protection from disasters, safe childbirth, and family harmony. Historical importance was solidified in 807 AD when imperial ceremonies were conducted here to pacify Mount Fuji following a major eruption. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengen_shrine)
