NEXCO Central (Central Nippon Expressway Company Limited) operates the Chuo Expressway connecting Tokyo to the Fujikawaguchiko area, maintaining a network of service areas (SA) and parking areas (PA) spaced at regular intervals along the route. These facilities provide essential rest stops, dining options, fuel services, and restroom facilities for highway travelers. [🔗](https://www.c-nexco.co.jp/en/)

The company has developed these facilities beyond basic amenities into destinations that aim to be "more comfortable, more convenient and more enjoyable," incorporating regional character and local food specialties. The approximately 120 km route from Tokyo to Kawaguchiko IC features multiple standard rest facilities in addition to premium EXPASA locations.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Japanese expressway service areas have evolved significantly from simple rest stops to cultural destinations. In surveys of motorists on leisure trips, 49.7% stated they had visited well-known service areas as either a primary or secondary destination, reflecting their importance in Japanese travel culture.

NEXCO Central facilities represent Japan's commitment to driver safety and comfort, with rest facilities strategically positioned approximately every 15 kilometers (parking areas) and every 50 kilometers (service areas). This systematic approach ensures no driver goes extended periods without rest opportunities, contributing to Japan's excellent highway safety record. All facilities feature exceptionally clean restrooms, regional food offerings, and local product shopping - elements that distinguish Japanese expressway culture from many other countries.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Strategic Rest Stop Planning

**Recommended Stop Intervals:**
Japanese expressway rest facilities are positioned at regular intervals for driver safety. Drivers are encouraged to take breaks at these facilities to maintain alertness and comfort during long drives. [🔗](https://globalsapa.c-nexco.co.jp/en/tipstricks/drivers/)

**For Tokyo to Kawaguchiko Route (120 km, 1.5 hours):**
1. **Fujino PA** (~20 km from Tokyo): Quick initial stop if needed
2. **Dangozaka SA** (~60-70 km): Main recommended rest stop - comprehensive facilities, approximately halfway point
3. **Yamura PA** (~100-110 km): Final stop before Kawaguchiko - important for fuel top-up

**Fuel Strategy:**
Fill up at service areas earlier than usual to avoid running out of fuel on the expressway. Yamura PA's gas station is particularly important as it's the last convenient fueling opportunity before reaching Kawaguchiko. [🔗](https://en.driveplaza.com/sapa/1100/1100081/1/)

### Driving Considerations

**Service Area vs. Parking Area Strategy:**
- **Service Areas (SA):** Choose for longer breaks (20-30 minutes), full meals, shopping, or fuel
- **Parking Areas (PA):** Adequate for quick breaks (10-15 minutes), restroom stops, vending machine snacks

**Best Visit Times:**
- **Avoid Peak Meal Times:** 12:00-13:00 (lunch) and 18:00-19:00 (dinner) see heaviest crowds
- **Early Morning:** Less crowded, though some restaurants may have limited hours
- **Late Evening:** 24-hour dining options (like Sukiya) available without crowds

### Route Integration

**How This Fits with Chuo Expressway:**
Service areas and parking areas are strategically integrated into the expressway system, providing mandatory rest opportunities at safe intervals. The Tokyo to Fujikawaguchiko section features well-spaced facilities allowing drivers to plan rest stops based on personal needs rather than facility availability.

**Connection with Route Journey:**
- All facilities directly accessible from expressway (no exit required)
- Positioned at intervals supporting driver safety and comfort
- Larger service areas (like Dangozaka) offer comprehensive experiences
- Smaller parking areas provide quick rest opportunities
- Spacing ensures no extended periods without facility access

**Timing in Overall Journey:**
Plan main rest stop at Dangozaka SA (approximately halfway). Use Fujino PA only if needing very early break. Consider Yamura PA for final fuel top-up and restroom break before Kawaguchiko IC exit.

### Budget Considerations

**Money-Saving Options:**
- **ETC Card:** Obtain through rental car company for 30% toll discounts (late night or weekend/holiday periods)
- **Convenience Store Options:** More economical than full-service restaurants
- **Vending Machines:** 24-hour availability at lower prices than restaurant beverages
- **Free Facilities:** Restrooms, parking, Wi-Fi at no cost

**Estimated Costs:**
- Parking: Free (included with expressway toll)
- Restroom Access: Free
- Convenience Store Meal: ¥300-600
- Food Court Meal: ¥500-1,200 per person

- **Queue Discipline:** Form orderly lines at food counters and cash registers
