## Cultural & Historical Significance

### The Michi-no-Eki System

Government-designated rest areas combine five core functions: rest & safety (free 24/7 parking and clean toilets), information hub (road conditions and tourist information), local economy (platform for regional products), community space (meeting place for locals and visitors), and cultural gateway (introduction to local cuisine and traditions). After over 30 years, these stations have evolved into central hubs for rural communities, helping preserve regional identities while supporting local economies.

Narusawa Village, located in the foothills of Mount Fuji within Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, has a long agricultural heritage centered on highland vegetable cultivation. The village's elevation and climate create ideal conditions for producing sweet, high-quality vegetables including the famous Narusawa cabbage and traditional Narusawa greens (Narusawana). The station's location provides visitors with spectacular views of Japan's most iconic peak, offering a cultural introduction to the mountain's significance while serving as a gateway to Mt. Fuji experiences. [üîó](https://www.yamanashi-kankou.jp/english/discover/road-station-narusawa.html)
