Izu Shaboten Zoo (伊豆シャボテン動物公園) is a zoological park and botanical garden in Itō, Shizuoka, Japan, founded in 1959. The park is located beside Mount Omuro, a grass-covered volcanic cone near central Ito on the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Shaboten_Zoo)

The zoo is named for its location on the Izu Peninsula while "shaboten" (シャボテン) is a historical Japanese word that commonly referred to cacti up until the 1960s. The term derives from "shabon" (シャボン, from Portuguese *sabão*), meaning soap, as prickly pear cactus juice was used as a soap substitute. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Shaboten_Zoo)

The park houses approximately 1,500 species of cacti and succulents alongside 140 animal species, presented through a unique "activity zoo" concept (*taiken-gata dōbutsuen* 体験型動物園) that emphasizes close interaction (*fureai*) between visitors and animals. [🔗](https://izushaboten.com/en/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### The Cactus Collection: A Cultural Exhibition

The Izu Shaboten Zoo opened in 1959 as one of the first institutions in Japan to feature a large-scale exhibition of cacti and succulents. The five greenhouses are designed to evoke the climates and cultures of the cacti's native lands, with particular focus on ancient Mexico. Replica pre-Columbian stone statues from sites like Monte Albán transform the greenhouses into narrative spaces, connecting the plants to their civilizational origins. This approach reflects the Japanese cultural tendency to appreciate items not just for their aesthetics, but for their history and story (*monogatari*).

Cactus cultivation in Japan has a 300-year history as part of the sophisticated horticultural tradition (*engei bunka* 園芸文化). Cacti were introduced during the Edo period (1603-1868) and became appreciated by enthusiasts much like bonsai and orchids—valued for their patience, precision, and the challenge of cultivation. The collection includes specimens like a 170-year-old "King Golden Ball" cactus, representing a modern manifestation of this deep-seated cultural appreciation for horticulture.

### The Capybara Onsen: Birthplace of a National Tradition

Izu Shaboten Zoo is the originator (*ganso* 元祖) of the now-famous Capybara Outdoor Bath tradition, which has become a beloved winter event (*fuyu no fūbutsushi* 冬の風物詩). [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/capybaras-japan-izu-shaboten-zoo/)

The tradition began in 1982 when an employee cleaning the capybara enclosure with hot water noticed the animals huddling together in a warm puddle. Recognizing their enjoyment of the warmth, staff began preparing warm baths for them, creating what has become an iconic Japanese zoo tradition. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Shaboten_Zoo)

The phenomenon's immense popularity is deeply tied to Japan's own love for onsen (hot spring) culture. For the Japanese, onsen symbolize relaxation, health, and simple pleasure. Seeing capybaras with blissful expressions soaking in steaming baths resonates powerfully—it's a charming, humorous, and heartwarming image combining two beloved elements: cute animals and the relaxing ritual of the onsen. Video clips of the capybaras have gained millions of views, and the zoo's capybaras have influenced the character "Kapibara-san" and associated merchandise.

## The Experience

### Interactive "Activity Zoo" Concept

Izu Shaboten Zoo stands out as an "activity animal park" (*taiken-gata dōbutsuen* 体験型動物園), defined by its emphasis on minimizing barriers between animals and visitors. The core concept is *fureai* (ふれあい), meaning "contact" or "interaction." [🔗](https://izushaboten.com/en/)

**Free-Roaming Animals:** Peacocks and squirrel monkeys roam freely within the zoo grounds. Squirrel monkeys are particularly keen on approaching or climbing on visitors who have food. [🔗](https://www.kanpai-japan.com/ito/izu-shaboten-zoo)

**Direct Interaction Opportunities:**
- Enter areas where capybaras and kangaroos live
- Feed treats to multiple species including capybaras, kangaroos, llamas, goats, sheep, and red pandas (limited quantities)
- Walk into the large enclosed kangaroo area

[🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/shizuoka/outdoor-activities/izu-shaboten-zoo)

The "Monkey Island Landing Course" allows visitors to physically interact with lemurs and feed them while they climb harmlessly on visitors—the only place in Japan offering this type of lemur interaction.
