Numazu Port is a thriving fishing port and culinary destination facing Suruga Bay, the deepest bay in Japan (2,500 meters deep). [🔗](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/blog/enjoy-a-deep-exploration-of-numazu-port/) The port handles the second-largest volume of mackerel, horse mackerel, sardines, and bonito in Japan, second only to Yaizu Port in Shizuoka Prefecture. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/11749/) This unique geographical position at the mouth of Suruga Bay makes Numazu Port a premier destination for experiencing both conventional seafood and rare deep-sea fish species.

The port area has evolved into a comprehensive dining and entertainment district with over 70 restaurants and shops, [🔗](https://guidememo.com/numazu-fishmarket/) centered around three main complexes: Numazu Fish Market INO (opened 2007), Numazu Minato Shinsenkan market mall, and Minato 83 Banchi restaurant district. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100371/)

November is an excellent time to visit Numazu Port, with autumn bringing cooler temperatures and increased visibility of Mount Fuji. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g1019668-Activities-Numazu_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html) Seasonal specialties available in November include sakura shrimp (autumn fishing season runs late October to late December), whitebait (shirasu), deep-water shrimp, and spear squid.

## Cultural & Fishing Heritage

Numazu's culture is deeply intertwined with the sea. The extreme depth of Suruga Bay has created a unique ecosystem that supports both conventional fishing and specialized deep-sea fishing operations. The port lands fresh fish throughout the year, with commercial vessels unloading their catches daily at the wholesale market. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100371/)

The fishing industry's historical significance was recognized as early as 1899 when a dedicated spur rail line to Numazu Port was established. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numazu_Station) This infrastructure enabled efficient distribution of the port's catches throughout Japan, cementing Numazu's reputation as a major seafood center.

The port is renowned as Japan's largest producer of himono (dried fish), especially dried horse mackerel, accounting for approximately half of Japan's total production. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numazu) This centuries-old preservation technique has roots in Japan's Jomon period, with modern methods established in the Taisho and Showa eras. [🔗](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/blog/enjoy-a-deep-exploration-of-numazu-port/)

### Deep-Sea Fish Specialties

Suruga Bay's depth provides access to rare deep-sea species that form the basis of Numazu's most distinctive culinary offerings. Key species include:

- **Arame ginme (Beardfish)**: Known for its surprisingly sweet taste when served as sashimi [🔗](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/04/news/numazu-restaurants-focus-on-deep-sea-specialities/)
