Mount Amagi (天城山, Amagi-san) is a range of volcanic mountains in central Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, forming the border between Izu City and Higashi-Izu Town. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Amagi) The highest peak, Banzaburodake (万三郎岳), reaches 1,406 meters (4,613 feet), making it the highest point on the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://ridgelineimages.com/hiking/mt-amagi/)

Mount Amagi is listed as one of Japan's 100 Famous Mountains (Hyakumeizan), a prestigious designation compiled by mountaineer Kyuya Fukada. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Amagi) This recognition reflects not just the mountain's height or difficulty, but its character, history, and cultural distinctiveness as a classic Japanese hiking destination.

The mountain range is a central feature of the Izu Peninsula UNESCO Global Geopark, designated in 2018 for its unique geological heritage shaped by ongoing volcanic activity and tectonic plate collisions. [🔗](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/izu-peninsula-unesco-global-geopark)

## Geological and Natural Significance

Mount Amagi represents a geological marvel within the Izu Peninsula UNESCO Global Geopark. The southern portion of the peninsula is composed largely of breccia, while the central and northern portions consist of numerous highly eroded volcanoes, with the Amagi Mountain Range dominating the center. [🔗](https://english.izugeopark.org/about-izugeo/) The geological history dates back approximately 20 million years when the area was located about 800 kilometers south near the Tropic of Cancer as volcanic groups in the deep sea. [🔗](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/izu-peninsula-unesco-global-geopark)

The central Amagi highland receives a flow of humid air from the Pacific, resulting in high levels of precipitation (over 4,000mm/year at Mount Amagi) and frequent snowfall during winter. [🔗](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/izu-peninsula-unesco-global-geopark) This abundant moisture nourishes the mountain's most distinctive feature: primeval beech forests covered in emerald moss, creating a serene and mystical atmosphere. [🔗](https://ridgelineimages.com/hiking/mt-amagi/)

The mountain is famous for Amagi-shakunage (Rhododendron amagianum), a pink rhododendron species endemic to the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Rhododendron_amagianum) This endangered species originated from Mounts Amagi and Higane, and its fuchsia-orange flowers bloom in early summer (mid-May to early June), attracting hikers during peak bloom season. [🔗](https://www.treesandshrubsonline.org/articles/rhododendron/rhododendron-amagianum/)

## Literary and Cultural Importance

Mount Amagi holds profound literary significance as the setting for Nobel Prize-winning author Yasunari Kawabata's 1926 novella "The Izu Dancer" (Izu no Odoriko). [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dancing_Girl_of_Izu) The story follows a young student's journey through the Izu Peninsula, with the Old Amagi Tunnel serving as a pivotal landmark where the protagonist transitions from solitary youth to opening up to companionship and emotion. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/kawabata-izu-dancer-literary-journey/)

The Old Amagi Tunnel itself, built in 1905 after 13 years of construction, is a 445.5-meter stone tunnel designated as a national Important Cultural Property in 2001. [🔗](https://hikingtokyo.com/2025/06/08/hiking-the-odoriko-trail-highest-point-719m-izu-city-shizuoka-prefecture-saturday-april-19-2025/) Today, the tunnel has become a pilgrimage site, with literary tourists retracing the novella's route through lush forests, old tunnels, and quiet hot-spring villages.
