Kawazu Seven Waterfalls (河津七滝, Kawazu Nanadaru) is a series of seven waterfalls along the Hontani River, formed 25,000 years ago when the Noborio Minami volcano erupted and its lava flowed into the valley, creating spectacular columnar basalt rock formations that remain visible today. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6313.html) [🔗](https://jref.com/articles/kawazu-seven-waterfalls.543/)

The site received two stars in the Michelin Green Guide Japan (6th revised edition) in February 2020 and is part of the UNESCO-designated Izu Peninsula Geopark, recognized for its outstanding geological significance and volcanic heritage.

## The Seven Waterfalls - Complete Catalog

The seven waterfalls all end with "daru" (meaning waterfall) and range from the 30-meter tall Odaru to the 2-meter tall Kanidaru. From the first to the seventh waterfall is approximately 1.3 kilometers, making the round-trip trail about 2.6 kilometers total. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6313.html)

### 1. Odaru (大滝) - "Large Waterfall"
**Height:** 30 meters | **Width:** 7 meters

The tallest and most impressive of the seven falls, featuring beautiful columnar joints and hot spring water gushing forth from its side. Odaru has a swimming hole and hot baths beside the stream at the Amagiso Odaru Onsen.

### 3. Shokeidaru (初景滝) - "First View Waterfall"
**Height:** 10 meters | **Width:** 7 meters

Considered the most picturesque of the seven falls for photography, Shokeidaru features the famous bronze statue "The Dancing Girl and I" (Odoriko) inspired by Kawabata Yasunari's novel "The Izu Dancer." [🔗](https://www.theinvisibletourist.com/kawazu-seven-waterfalls/) The area is easily accessible on a paved concrete path with a slight slope, and the falls plunge into a beautiful, clear pool. This location offers the best photography opportunities within the entire Kawazu Seven Falls tour.

### 4. Hebidaru (蛇滝) - "Snake Waterfall"
**Height:** 3 meters | **Width:** 2 meters

Named for the patterns in the surrounding rocks that resemble snake scales (hebi in Japanese), revealing the volcanic origin of the Izu Peninsula. From the Kawazu Odoriko Takimi Bridge, visitors can get a clear view of the black hexagonal basalt formations. [🔗](https://www.theinvisibletourist.com/kawazu-seven-waterfalls/)

### 5. Ebidaru (海老滝) - "Shrimp Waterfall"
**Height:** 5 meters | **Width:** 3 meters

Named for its shape resembling the tail fin of a shrimp (ebi in Japanese), featuring distinctive rock formations. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1278/)

### 6. Kanidaru (かに滝) - "Crab Waterfall"
**Height:** 2 meters | **Width:** 1 meter

The smallest of the seven falls, distinguished by the beautiful contrast created between the whiteness of the running waterfall and the greenery of the mountain. Despite its small size, the contrast between the deep blue water and pure white foam creates stunning photographic opportunities. [🔗](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/blog/travel-like-locals/touring-the-kawazu-seven-falls-lots-of-negative-ions-and-a-great-choice-for-active-goals/)

### 7. Deaidaru (出合滝) - "Meeting Waterfall"

Named after the confluence of the Kawazu River and the Hagino-irigawa River, which is likened to a meeting of life. The volcanic lava flows create magnificent columnar joints visible on either side of the waterfall. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1278/)

## Cultural & Geological Significance

### Volcanic Heritage & Columnar Basalt Formations

The Kawazu Seven Waterfalls were formed 25,000 years ago when molten lava from the Noborio Minami volcano cooled and contracted, creating spectacular columnar joints—pillar-shaped rock formations visible throughout the waterfall area. When the surface and bottom of the lava cooled, it shrunk and created cracks that formed these vertical polygonal prisms. [🔗](https://jref.com/articles/kawazu-seven-waterfalls.543/)

The river carved its bed into these spectacular basalt rock formations, creating stunningly regular arrays of hexagonal and polygonal columns that demonstrate the volcanic origins of the Izu Peninsula. These formations are particularly visible at Deaidaru and Hebidaru waterfalls, where visitors can observe the geometric precision of the cooled lava structures. [🔗](https://www.theinvisibletourist.com/kawazu-seven-waterfalls/)

As part of the Izu Peninsula Geopark, designated by UNESCO, the site represents an outstanding example of volcanic geology and provides educational value about earth sciences and geological processes. [🔗](https://www.travelynotes.com/blog-japan/kawazu-seven-falls-a-nature-lovers-hidden-gem-on-the-izu-peninsula)

### Literary Significance - "The Izu Dancer" Connection

Several bronze statues along the walking trail depict characters from "Izu no Odoriko" (The Izu Dancer, 1926), one of several works by Nobel Prize-winning author Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972, awarded 1968) that are set in this area of the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6313.html)

The most famous statue at Shokeidaru Falls features "The Dancing Girl and I," representing the main characters from Kawabata's beloved short story. The trail itself is often referred to as the "Odoriko Trail" in honor of the literary work that made this region famous. The statues create excellent photo opportunities with the waterfalls in the background, combining natural beauty with cultural heritage. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/shizuoka/kawazu-nanadaru-seven-waterfalls/45026)

The Kawazu Station plaza also features a bronze statue of the two protagonists, reinforcing how deeply "The Izu Dancer" has shaped the town's cultural identity and image. [🔗](https://voyapon.com/kawabata-izu-dancer-literary-journey/)

## November Visiting Experience

### Autumn Foliage Season

**Peak Foliage:** Late November to early December [🔗](https://www.livetheworld.com/activities/japan/seven-waterfalls-kawazu)

**What to Expect:** November is considered one of the best times to visit Kawazu Seven Waterfalls for autumn foliage. The area features many Japanese maple trees along the walking trail, and the autumn leaves around Kanidaru (Crab Falls) and Kamadaru are particularly beautiful. The area around the waterfalls is "dyed red with autumn leaves," creating a fantastical space enhanced by the sound of flowing water and vibrant colors. [🔗](https://www.livetheworld.com/activities/japan/seven-waterfalls-kawazu)

**Special Event:** The **Amagiji Momiji Festival** (Amagiji Maple Festival) is celebrated every autumn in this area, showcasing the spectacular fall colors. [🔗](https://www.outdoorjapan.com/sponsored-content/fall-in-love-with-kawazu/)

### Weather Considerations

**Temperature Range:** November temperatures in Kawazu average 12-16°C

**Precipitation:** November typically receives approximately 93mm of precipitation, so rain gear is advisable

**Trail Conditions After Rain:** The waterfalls have stronger water currents and appear more dramatic after rainfall, but the floor becomes wet and slippery. Visitors must be especially careful on stairs and rocky sections. Water spray constantly coats the pathways along with leaf litter, requiring extra caution. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1121206-d1238306-Reviews-Kawazu_Nanadaru_Waterfalls-Kawazu_cho_Kamo_gun_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**Optimal Season:** Spring and autumn are considered the best times to visit when the weather is mild and natural beauty is at its peak. [🔗](https://www.livetheworld.com/activities/japan/seven-waterfalls-kawazu)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Strategic Planning

**Direction Matters:** The single most important tip from experienced visitors is to take the bus to the upper Mizudare entrance and walk downhill. The considerable elevation gain makes the uphill direction from the parking lot significantly more challenging. Walking downhill is described as "easy" and allows you to enjoy the waterfalls without exhausting yourself. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1121206-d1238306-Reviews-Kawazu_Nanadaru_Waterfalls-Kawazu_cho_Kamo_gun_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**Time Allocation:** Allow 2 hours minimum to visit all seven waterfalls at a comfortable pace. Add additional time if planning to bathe at the Amagiso Onsen or if you want extensive photography time. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6313.html)

**Limited Mobility Option:** If traveling with elderly visitors or children, focus on Shokeidaru Fall, which is the most accessible and offers the best photography opportunities on an easier paved path. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1121206-d1238306-Reviews-Kawazu_Nanadaru_Waterfalls-Kawazu_cho_Kamo_gun_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

### What to Bring

**Footwear:** Wear shoes with excellent grip. The pathways vary from paved concrete to rocky and uneven surfaces, and water spray constantly coats them along with leaf litter. Proper hiking shoes or trail runners with good tread are essential for safety. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1121206-d1238306-Reviews-Kawazu_Nanadaru_Waterfalls-Kawazu_cho_Kamo_gun_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**Weather Gear:** Bring rain gear, especially in November when precipitation is common. After rain, trails are wetter and more slippery but waterfalls are more dramatic. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1121206-d1238306-Reviews-Kawazu_Nanadaru_Waterfalls-Kawazu_cho_Kamo_gun_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**For Onsen Visit:** Pack a swimsuit if planning to bathe at Amagiso Odaru Onsen (mixed bathing facility, swimsuit required). Towels are typically available for rent or purchase. [🔗](https://wanderingdonut.com/waterfall-onsen-japan-amagiso-odaru/)
