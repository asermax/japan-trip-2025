Kinmedai, scientifically known as Beryx splendens and commonly called golden eye snapper or splendid alfonsino in English, is a deep-sea fish that has become synonymous with Izu Peninsula cuisine. The fish is instantly recognizable by its vibrant ruby-red skin and large, golden eyes—adaptations for life in the dark depths of the ocean between 25 and 1,250 meters. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendid_alfonsino)

The Izu Peninsula, particularly Shimoda Port, boasts the highest catch of kinmedai in all of Japan, making it the premier destination for experiencing this delicacy. [🔗](https://www.princehotels.com/shimoda/experience/savoring-japans-premier-kinmedai/) The fish caught in the waters around Inatori and Shimoda are especially prized, with "Inatori Kinmedai" being a trademarked designation for the highest quality specimens landed at Inatori Fishing Port.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

In Japanese culture, the color red is considered auspicious and is often associated with celebrations and good fortune, elevating kinmedai from a simple meal to a dish served on special occasions. [🔗](https://tenposstar.com/en/articles/r/2622/) The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recognizes kinmedai simmered dishes as a traditional local cuisine of Shizuoka Prefecture, specifically mentioning Shimoda City and Higashiizu Town as production areas. [🔗](https://www.oishi-washoku-recipes.com/simmered-kinmedai)

The fish is celebrated for its uniquely rich, sweet, and fatty flavor profile with a firm yet delicate texture that melts in your mouth. Kinmedai is fatty all year round, has soft flesh and few small bones, making it easy to eat and perfect for various preparations.

### Fishing Heritage

The communities of Shimoda and Inatori are deeply intertwined with the sea and kinmedai fishing. Shimoda celebrates its connection with the annual **Shimoda Kinme Festival** held every June, where local restaurants offer special kinmedai dishes and the entire city joins in celebrating its most famous resident. [🔗](https://tenposstar.com/en/articles/r/2622/)

Inatori is renowned for its traditional fishing method called **"tatenawa"** (standing rope fishing), which uses a vertical longline with many hooks lowered into the deep sea where the kinmedai live. This skillful and targeted method respects the marine environment and ensures the fish are caught with minimal damage, preserving their quality—a source of pride for local fishermen. [🔗](https://tenposstar.com/en/articles/r/2622/)

## Traditional Preparation Methods

### Nitsuke (Simmered)

The most popular way to enjoy kinmedai in Izu, this preparation involves simmering the fish in a flavorful broth made of soy sauce, sake, mirin, and ginger. [🔗](https://www.justonecookbook.com/kinmedai-nitsuke/) The fish is typically covered with a drop lid and simmered on medium heat for about 15 minutes, with the broth scooped over the fish occasionally to ensure the flavors penetrate thoroughly. This quintessential Japanese comfort food represents a simple, traditional, and heartfelt way of cooking that enhances the fish's natural umami while tenderizing the flesh.

### Sashimi (Raw)

When served as sashimi, kinmedai highlights its freshness and delicate, sweet flavor. The preparation often involves lightly grilling the skin with charcoal or a blowtorch while the flesh remains raw. [🔗](https://travel.ava-intel.com/en/cuisine/7417763/) At traditional Edomae sushi restaurants, this fish is usually aged for 2 to 3 days after being dispatched using the ikejime technique, allowing the fish's natural enzymes to break down the proteins in the flesh, increasing the flavor and texture. [🔗](https://www.bigfridgeboy.com/en/blog/7672/what-is-kinmedai-golden-eye-snapper-)

### Aburi (Flame-Broiled)

This modern technique involves lightly searing the surface of the fish with a torch, leaving the inside raw. The process adds a pleasant smokiness and a hint of caramelization that contrasts beautifully with the soft, fatty flesh. The skin is gently seared using the "Aburi" technique, which helps to tenderize it and unlock the umami flavors from the natural oils.

## Visiting Information

### November Seasonal Considerations

**Peak Season:** November falls perfectly within kinmedai's peak season (October to late March), when the fish accumulates more fat to survive the cold water, resulting in a richer, more buttery flavor highly prized by connoisseurs. [🔗](https://fujinokuni.shokunomiyako-shizuoka.pref.shizuoka.jp/en/culture/article/2493)

**Weather Considerations:** Early November in Izu offers pleasant autumn weather with comfortable temperatures for dining and exploring fishing towns. The coastal areas maintain mild conditions ideal for visiting seaside restaurants.

**Crowd Levels:** November is outside peak summer tourism season, offering a more authentic local dining experience with potentially shorter wait times at popular restaurants.

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Japanese Dining Etiquette

**Before Eating:** Say "Itadakimasu" (I gratefully receive) before beginning your meal to show respect for the food and those who prepared it.

**Chopstick Etiquette:**
- Never stick chopsticks vertically into rice (resembles funeral rites)
- Do not pass food directly from chopsticks to another person's chopsticks
- Use the blunt end of chopsticks to take food from shared plates if no serving utensils are provided
- Place chopsticks on a chopstick rest (hashioki) when not in use

**During the Meal:**
- It is polite to lift rice or soup bowls to your mouth
- Slurping noodles is acceptable and shows enjoyment
- Finish everything on your plate to show appreciation

**After Eating:** Express gratitude by saying "Gochisousama deshita" (Thank you for the feast) [🔗](https://tenposstar.com/en/articles/r/2622/)

### Dining Strategy

**Best Time to Visit:** Lunch service (11:30 AM-2:00 PM) offers the best value with set meals, though dinner service provides a more leisurely experience. Arrive early or make reservations, especially at highly-rated establishments like Gorosaya and Kinmetei.

**Reservations:** Strongly recommended for Gorosaya and Kinmetei, which are small establishments that fill up quickly. Japanese-speaking assistance may be helpful for booking.

**Payment:** Kinmetei is cash-only with ticket machine ordering. Confirm payment methods at other restaurants before dining.

**Language:** English menus available at Gorosaya, Tokuzomaru, and Honke Maguroya. Kinmetei uses a ticket machine system which may have pictures to help with ordering.

**Photography:** Generally acceptable in restaurants, but ask permission before photographing other diners. Food photography is widely accepted and expected in Japanese dining culture.

**Preparation Recommendations:** Try multiple preparation styles if possible—the Kinmedai Zukushi Set at Tokuzomaru offers an excellent introduction with grilled, raw, shabu-shabu, and miso soup preparations in one meal. [🔗](https://matcha-jp.com/en/10820)

**Transportation:** Both Shimoda and Inatori are accessible via the Izu Kyuko Line. Consider renting a car for flexibility in visiting multiple restaurants and exploring the coastal fishing ports between dining experiences.

**Souvenir Opportunities:** Tokuzomaru and Kinmetei both offer souvenir shops with local specialties, sauces, and pickles—perfect for bringing home Izu flavors.

## Integration with Izu Peninsula Exploration

Kinmedai dining experiences integrate naturally with coastal exploration of the Izu Peninsula. Both Shimoda and Inatori offer beautiful harbor areas perfect for pre- or post-meal walks. The Michi-no-Eki roadside station at Kinmetei provides tourist information and local products, making it an ideal starting point for Shimoda exploration.

Inatori's fishing port area offers authentic working harbor atmosphere, while Shimoda combines maritime heritage with historical significance as one of Japan's first ports opened to foreign trade. Consider timing your kinmedai meal with visits to nearby coastal attractions, hot springs, or scenic viewpoints along the eastern Izu coast.

The restaurants' locations along the eastern Izu coast make them convenient stops during drives between major destinations on the peninsula, allowing you to experience this regional delicacy while enjoying the dramatic coastal scenery that characterizes the area.
