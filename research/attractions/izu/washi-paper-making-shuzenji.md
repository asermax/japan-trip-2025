ShuzenjiGami is a traditional washi paper-making workshop in Shuzenji, Izu Peninsula, where visitors can experience the 1,000-year-old craft of handmade Japanese paper production. The workshop is led by Takuto Masuda, a modern craftsman working to revive the ancient art of Shuzenji paper-making that once served as the official paper of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Shuzenji has maintained an art of paper-making passed down through generations for 1,000 years, with washi production deeply rooted in the region's history. Once the official paper of the Tokugawa shogunate, Shuzenji's washi became nearly obsolete by the 20th century with the arrival of Western paper production. Recently, local communities have begun fighting to revive the craft of Shuzenji-gami, making this workshop a rare opportunity to experience and support a living cultural tradition.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### The Mitsumata Tradition

ShuzenjiGami preserves the legacy of using the three-branched mitsumata tree (Edgeworthia chrysantha) as the primary raw material for paper-making. [ðŸ”—](https://discoverizu.com/traditional_japanese_crafts/) Takuto Masuda, the proprietor, not only makes the paper but also grows his own mitsumata plants, ensuring complete control over the quality and authenticity of the traditional process. [ðŸ”—](https://discoverizu.com/traditional_japanese_crafts/)

Mitsumata produces fibers that are soft, absorbent, and insect resistant, forming a sponge-like network that creates exceptional paper. The highest quality mitsumata fibers are used in making the paper that Japanese bank notes are printed on. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japanesepaperplace.com/news/gampi-and-mitsumata/) The first mitsumata paper in Japanese history was a black-sealed document dated March 4, 1598 from Ieyasu Tokugawa to the Misu family, establishing the material's historical significance. [ðŸ”—](https://omurasaki.jp/en/rekishi/)

### Historical Connection to Tokugawa Shogunate

Mitsumata paper-making (mitsumata-gami) began to be manufactured in Shuzenji (now the east side of Shizuoka Prefecture) and then spread to Suruga and Koshu regions. [ðŸ”—](https://omurasaki.jp/en/rekishi/) The elevation of Shuzenji washi to become the official paper of the Tokugawa shogunate demonstrates the exceptional quality and cultural importance of this regional craft tradition.

### UNESCO Cultural Heritage Context

Washi papermaking was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2014. [ðŸ”—](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/washi-craftsmanship-of-traditional-japanese-hand-made-paper-01001) The craft is transmitted through three levels: among families of washi craftspeople (working under master craftsmen who inherited techniques from parents), through preservation associations, and by local municipalities. [ðŸ”—](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/washi-craftsmanship-of-traditional-japanese-hand-made-paper-01001)

By participating in this workshop, visitors directly support the preservation and transmission of this 1,300-year-old craft tradition, making it more than just a tourist activityâ€”it's active cultural preservation. Washi is used to repair historically valuable cultural properties, paintings, and books at museums and libraries around the world, including the Louvre and the Vatican Museums. [ðŸ”—](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/washi-craftsmanship-of-traditional-japanese-hand-made-paper-01001) Some documents written on washi 1,000 years ago are still preserved today, demonstrating the exceptional durability of this traditional paper.

### The Nagashi-Zuki Method

Participants learn the nagashi-zuki method, the traditional Japanese papermaking technique developed around 805-809 CE. [ðŸ”—](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/japanese-book-paper/0/steps/47486) This method involves drawing paper pulp into its solution in quick succession until it spreads evenly over a bamboo screen sieve. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g14134311-d26678704-Japanese_Paper_Washi_Making_Experience_in_Asakusa-Asakusa_Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Pref.html)

The nagashi-zuki technique adds mucilage (neri) to suspend the fibers during sheet formation, allowing for stronger interlocking of long paper fibers and producing thinner, stronger paper than other methods. [ðŸ”—](https://poj.co.jp/paper/process/process-nagashi-zuki/)
