Route 135, affectionately known as the **Izu Orange Line**, is Japan's National Route 135 (国道135号, *Kokudō Hyaku Sanjū Go-gō*), a scenic coastal highway that runs 104.5 kilometers along the eastern coast of the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/国道135号) The route connects Shimoda City in Shizuoka Prefecture to Odawara City in Kanagawa Prefecture, passing through popular resort towns including Atami, Ito, and Kawazu while offering stunning Pacific Ocean views.

Route 135 is a picturesque two-lane highway that closely hugs the eastern coastline of the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/) The route offers dynamic scenery with constantly changing views—stunning, uninterrupted vistas of Sagami Bay and the Pacific Ocean on one side, and lush green hills and volcanic cliffs on the other.

The road hugs the natural coastline, resulting in many curves, bends, and tunnels that make for an engaging drive rather than a monotonous highway journey. While generally well-maintained as a national route, the road narrows significantly in older towns and can be congested during peak tourist seasons. Outside of urban areas, it opens up to beautiful coastal cruising. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/国道135号)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### The "Orange Line" Legacy

The nickname "Izu Orange Line" is a tribute to the region's deep historical and economic connection to citrus farming. The route is frequently lined with vibrant orange groves, especially visible during the October-to-May harvest season. [🔗](https://www.explore-izu.com/things-to-do-and-see/food-and-drink/)

Izu's citrus cultivation dates back to the Edo Period (1603-1868), when the Kishu Mikan was first planted in the region. [🔗](https://www.explore-izu.com/things-to-do-and-see/food-and-drink/) The modern Unshu Mikan (Satsuma mandarin) became widespread during the Meiji Era (1868-1912), thriving on Izu's warm, well-drained hillsides. Many groves are planted on steep, terraced hillsides that rise from the coast, creating a beautiful contrast between the blue ocean and the green and orange of the trees. Farms like Marufuku Garden and Asakura Mikan-en are situated directly along the highway, offering ocean views from their groves.

The famous Japanese children's song *"Mikan no Hana Saku Oka"* (The Hill Where Mikan Flowers Bloom) evokes the nostalgic image of Izu's citrus-covered landscapes, cementing the region's identity in Japanese popular culture.

### Route History

Route 135 was established in 1953 as a second-class national highway and upgraded to a general national highway in 1965. [🔗](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/国道135号) The route has undergone several improvement projects including bypasses and road expansions. In 2021, sections near Atami were severely impacted by a major landslide, though the route has since been restored.

The route embodies Izu's identity as both a coastal resort region and agricultural heartland. The "Orange Line" nickname reflects the deep integration of citrus cultivation into the landscape and local economy. For generations of Japanese families, driving Route 135 for mikan-gari (citrus picking) is a cherished seasonal tradition.

## November Visit Considerations

**Weather:**

November offers some of Izu's most favorable driving conditions with average high temperatures of 16.4°C (61.5°F) and lows of 12.3°C (54.1°F). [🔗](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/japan/izu-weather-november) Expect approximately 15.3 rainfall days with 93mm of precipitation during the month. No snow risk from March through December. [🔗](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/japan/izu-weather-november)

**Road Conditions:**

Excellent road conditions in November with no risk of snow or ice on this coastal route. The curvy mountain roads are manageable with Japan's low speed limits and generally slow traffic flow. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1019670-i28713-k10835085-Touring_the_Izu_Peninsula_in_fall-Shimoda_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**Visibility:**

The clearer autumn air increases chances of seeing Mount Fuji from viewpoints along the route. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/)

**Citrus Harvest:**

Prime viewing season for orange groves with Unshu Mikan harvest in full swing (October-May season). Terraced orchards will be heavy with fruit, creating the classic "Orange Line" landscape. [🔗](https://www.explore-izu.com/things-to-do-and-see/food-and-drink/)

**Crowds:**

Significantly lower traffic and tourist crowds compared to peak summer beach season or spring cherry blossom season. Weekday travel recommended to avoid any weekend congestion. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/)

**Autumn Foliage:**

While the coast itself isn't a prime spot for autumn colors, early-to-mid November may catch the beginning of fall foliage in the hillsides, with late November being optimal for *koyo* viewing. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1019670-i28713-k10835085-Touring_the_Izu_Peninsula_in_fall-Shimoda_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Driving Strategy

**Traffic Avoidance:**

During busy summer beach season, Route 135 often becomes heavily congested. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/) November weekdays offer the best experience with light traffic. Avoid weekends and national holidays when Tokyo residents visit the peninsula.

**Alternative Route:**

When Route 135 is congested, the Izu Skyline offers a more comfortable drive winding through the mountains. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/)

**Navigation:**

Use Mapcode or GPS coordinates for precise navigation to specific viewpoints and attractions. Many rest stops and scenic spots are well-marked with signs. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/)

**Timing:**

Start early morning to enjoy the best light for photography and avoid any midday traffic through towns. The late afternoon sun setting over the western coast creates beautiful lighting conditions along the eastern route.

### Photography Opportunities

**Best Spots:**
- Nishikigaura cliffs for dramatic coastal formations
- Ito Marine Town for marina and ocean vistas
- Terraced citrus groves against the ocean backdrop
- Jogasaki Coast suspension bridge and volcanic cliffs
- Town centers like Atami and Ito for urban coastal scenes

**Lighting:**

Morning light works well for westward views toward the mountains, while afternoon light is ideal for ocean photography.

### Local Experience

**Citrus Products:**

Stop at roadside stands and Michi no Eki stations to purchase fresh mikan, mikan juice, jams, and citrus-flavored desserts. Atami is particularly famous for its lemon products. [🔗](https://www.explore-izu.com/things-to-do-and-see/food-and-drink/)

**Footbaths:**

Take advantage of free footbaths at Ito Marine Town and other roadside stations—a quintessential Izu experience. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100010/)

**Mikan-Gari:**

Consider stopping at a mikan picking farm for a hands-on experience. November is perfect timing for Unshu Mikan harvest.

### Practical Considerations

**Fuel and Facilities:**

Gas stations and convenience stores are readily available in major towns (Atami, Ito, Shimoda). Stock up before longer stretches between cities.

**Restroom Breaks:**

Use roadside stations (Michi no Eki) or convenience stores for clean restroom facilities. [🔗](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-shizuoka/in-atami/article-a0005644/)

**Weather Preparation:**

Bring rain gear as November averages 15 rainfall days. Layer clothing for 12-16°C temperatures.

Most viewpoints and attractions offer dedicated parking areas. Ito Marine Town provides 297 free spaces, making it an excellent base for rest stops.
