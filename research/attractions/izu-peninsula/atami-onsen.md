Atami Onsen is Japan's largest coastal hot spring resort, located at the northeastern base of the Izu Peninsula in Shizuoka Prefecture, less than one hour from Tokyo via Tokaido Shinkansen. With over 1,500 years of history dating back to the Nara period (710-794), Atami gained nationwide fame as Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu's favorite retreat and has evolved from an exclusive Edo-period sanctuary to a thriving modern resort town.

The name "Atami" literally translates to "hot ocean," referencing the town's legendary hot springs that once bubbled from the seabed. Records confirm the springs' existence from as early as 713 CE, with waters attracting bathers since the Nara period (710-794). [ðŸ”—](https://article.bespes-jt.com/en/article/atami-onsen)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**The Tokugawa Connection:** Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu visited Atami in 1604 for therapeutic bathing and became so enamored with the healing properties that he initiated "Okumiyu," a custom of transporting barrels of Atami's hot spring water to Edo Castle for personal use. [ðŸ”—](https://tenposstar.com/en/articles/r/3587) This practice continued under his successors, solidifying Atami's status as a high-class resort favored by feudal lords and the Tokugawa Gosanke (three Tokugawa family branches). [ðŸ”—](https://www.bespes-jt.com/en/spot/1009)

**Literary Legacy:** Atami's fame expanded in the Meiji era through Ozaki Koyo's serialized novel *Konjiki Yasha* (The Golden Demon, 1897-1902), which features a pivotal dramatic scene set in Atami. A bronze statue of the novel's protagonists, Kanichi and Omiya, stands near Atami Sun Beach as an enduring landmark commemorating this literary connection.

**Modern Revitalization:** After experiencing significant decline following Japan's economic bubble burst in the 1990s, Atami has undergone a remarkable "Atami miracle" revival. Community-led "machimori" initiatives, strategic rebranding to attract younger demographics, and cultivation of "Showa retro" aesthetics have successfully reinvented the city as a destination for individual travelers and families.
