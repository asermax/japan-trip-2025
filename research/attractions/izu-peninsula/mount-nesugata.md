Mount Nesugata (寝姿山, Nesugatayama - meaning "sleeping woman mountain") is a 200-meter summit in Shimoda accessible via the Shimoda Ropeway, offering panoramic views of Shimoda Bay, the Pacific Ocean, and the Izu Seven Islands. The mountain earned its poetic name from the ridgeline silhouette that resembles a woman lying on her back. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoda_Ropeway)

The summit combines natural beauty with profound historical significance - from this strategic vantage point, lookouts monitored Commodore Matthew Perry's "Black Ships" in 1854, a pivotal moment that ended Japan's 220-year period of isolation and opened the nation to Western trade. Today, the summit features seasonal flower gardens, the Aizen-Do Buddhist pavilion (a renowned "power spot" for love and fertility), and replica cannons from Perry's fleet positioned at the restored Black Ship Lookout Post.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

**Historical Significance:**
The summit's military history manifests in the strategically placed replica cannons - artillery matching those aboard Commodore Perry's Black Ships - positioned at the restored lookout post originally established by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1849 following the appearance of a British survey ship. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/shizuoka/shimoda-mt-nesugata-to-gyokusenj/2557) These cannons remain aimed toward the bay where Perry's fleet anchored in 1854, forcing the signing of the Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity at nearby Ryosen-ji Temple on March 31, which opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American ships. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6301.html)

**Aizen-Do Buddhist Pavilion:**
At the center of the summit promenade stands the Aizen-Do, a vibrant octagonal Buddhist hall that is a 2/3-scale replica of the famous Yumedono (Hall of Dreams) at Horyu-ji Temple in Nara. [🔗](https://ropeway.co.jp/en-mt-nsugata/) This pavilion is dedicated to Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja), the Buddhist deity of love and desire, and houses a statue attributed to the renowned Kamakura-period sculptor Unkei. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/shizuoka/shimoda-mt-nesugata-to-gyokusenj/2557) The hall was relocated to Shimoda after the Meiji government's 19th-century policy mandating separation of Buddhism and Shintoism at Kamakura Hachimangu shrine.

This pavilion serves as one of Shimoda's most popular "power spots" (spiritual energy sites) for romance, fertility, and marital harmony.

**"Three Great Views of Izu":**
The summit observation deck is celebrated as one of the "Three Great Views of Izu," showcasing 360-degree panoramas encompassing Shimoda Port (where Perry's Black Ships anchored), the entire downtown area, Cape Suzaki extending into the Pacific Ocean, the Izu Seven Islands on the horizon, and Mount Amagi in the interior.
