The Jogasaki Coast (城ヶ崎海岸, Jōgasaki Kaigan) is a rugged stretch of dark volcanic coastline stretching approximately 9 kilometers along the Pacific Ocean. Formed by a massive volcanic eruption from Mount Omuro approximately 4,000 years ago, the coast features dramatic cliff formations, columnar jointing rock formations, sea caves, and some of the most spectacular coastal scenery on the Izu Peninsula. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/163/)

Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park and Izu Peninsula UNESCO Global Geopark, the coast offers well-maintained hiking trails, suspension bridges, a lighthouse with panoramic views, and educational opportunities about volcanic geology.

## Cultural & Geological Significance

### UNESCO Global Geopark Designation

The Jogasaki Coast is part of the Izu Peninsula UNESCO Global Geopark, which received its designation in April 2018. The Izu Peninsula is located at the northern edge of the Philippine Sea tectonic plate and at the far northern end of the Izu-Bonin volcanic arc—the only place in the world where two active volcanic arcs collide and where the various phenomena resulting from this can be observed. [🔗](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/izu-peninsula-unesco-global-geopark)

### Volcanic Formation History

The Jogasaki Coast was formed approximately 4,000 years ago when Mount Omuro (Omuroyama), a cinder cone volcano, experienced a massive eruption. The lava flows cascaded down the eastern coast of the Izu Peninsula, with molten rock surging into the sea, creating a jagged coastline filled with hidden coves and tide pools. [🔗](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/activities/places/mt-omuro-jogasaki-coast-walk/)

### Columnar Jointing

One of the most distinctive geological features at Jogasaki Coast is columnar jointing—a fascinating geological phenomenon where cooling lava forms hexagonal columns of rock. This unique feature is created when magma cools into multi-sided prismatic columns, and is easy to see along the Jogasaki Coast where surf runs off the columns in tiny waterfalls. At Oyodo-Koyodo, you can observe columnar joints formed when the lava slowly cools and hardens, with some columns large enough to accommodate about 3 people.
