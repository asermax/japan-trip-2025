The MOA Museum of Art stands as one of Japan's most architecturally distinctive and culturally significant art institutions, perched 250 meters above sea level on a hillside overlooking Sagami Bay in Atami. Founded in 1982 by Mokichi Okada (1882-1955), philosopher, artist, and founder of the Church of World Messianity, the museum embodies Okada's belief that art possesses transformative power to elevate the human spirit and create a harmonious society.

The museum's journey begins at the entrance, located 60 meters below the main building, where visitors embark on a remarkable 200-meter ascent through seven escalators. This underground passage, installed to preserve the mountain's scenic beauty, features continuously changing multicolored lighting that creates a transitional experience between the outside world and the art sanctuary above. The centerpiece of this journey is the circular hall, which presents Japan's largest kaleidoscopic projection mapping created by artists Mitsuru Yoda and Yuriko Yoda.

The museum underwent a comprehensive renovation in 2017 under the direction of renowned contemporary artist Hiroshi Sugimoto and architect Tomoyuki Sakakida. Their design philosophy emphasizes natural light and traditional Japanese materials, including Yakusugi cedar and black plaster, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere that honors centuries-old building techniques while incorporating modern architectural principles.

## Collection & Cultural Significance

The collection spans 3,500 artworks focusing on Japanese and East Asian art, including three designated National Treasures. The crown jewel is Ogata Kōrin's "Red and White Plum Blossoms" (Kōhaku Baizu Byōbu), a pair of two-panel folding screens created circa 1712-1716, considered one of the most celebrated works in Japanese art history. This masterpiece depicts a stylized flowing river with a white plum tree on one panel and a red plum tree on the other, demonstrating Kōrin's originality through asymmetrical composition and exquisite curved waterways. The museum displays these screens for one month annually in late winter, coinciding with plum blossom season. [🔗](https://www.moaart.or.jp/en/events/redandwhite/)

The other National Treasures include Nonomura Ninsei's "Tea-leaf Jar with a design of wisteria," a masterpiece of Kyoto ware ceramics, and "Tekagami Kanboku-jō," a calligraphy album featuring excerpts from the Heian and Kamakura periods. The museum also houses 67 Important Cultural Properties and 46 Important Art Objects. [🔗](https://www.moaart.or.jp/en/)

Beyond the main galleries, the museum houses the Golden Tea Room, a faithful reconstruction of the 16th-century gold-leaf-covered tearoom originally created for warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1586 for tea ceremonies with the emperor in Kyoto. The museum also features a fully functional Noh theater where traditional performances are held regularly, including special programs during spring and autumn seasons.

The museum grounds encompass a vast Japanese garden spanning 230,000 square meters, featuring a plum orchard, azalea hill, traditional teahouses, and bamboo forests. The garden is designed for year-round appreciation, with November being particularly spectacular due to vibrant autumn colors. From the main lobby and Moore Square, visitors enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of Atami, Sagami Bay, Izu Oshima, and Hatsushima islands. [🔗](https://www.moaart.or.jp/en/about_moa/seasons/autumn/)
