Shuzenji Onsen is the oldest and most famous onsen town on the Izu Peninsula, founded over 1,200 years ago by revered monk Kobo Daishi. Known as "Little Kyoto" of Izu, it combines spiritual heritage, natural hot springs, and literary significance with intimate ryokan culture and pristine autumn landscapes. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/travel/shuzenji-onsen-izu/)

The town's compact center stretches along the Katsura River for just a few hundred meters, preserving an atmosphere of traditional elegance with historic ryokan, vermillion-lacquered bridges, and the famous bamboo forest path. The quaint onsen town has stayed off the path of mass tourism, offering a pure and authentic Japanese experience centered on rest, relaxation, and cultural contemplation.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**Kobo Daishi's Legend:** The town's origins are inseparable from the legend of Kobo Daishi (Kukai, 774-835), the revered Buddhist monk who founded Shuzenji Temple in 807 AD. According to folklore, Kobo Daishi was moved by the sight of a boy caring for his ill father in the cold Katsura River. Striking a rock with his *tokko* (a Buddhist ritual pestle), he caused healing hot water to spring forth, creating Tokko-no-yu, the area's first hot spring. This act cemented the onsen's association with compassion, healing, and filial piety, defining the town's spiritual identity.

**Kamakura Period Tragedies:** During the Kamakura period (1185-1333), Shuzenji Temple became a somber memorial to brutal political power struggles. Minamoto no Noriyori, brother of first shogun Yoritomo, was exiled here in 1194 and forced to commit suicide. His nephew, Minamoto no Yoriie, the second shogun, was imprisoned at the temple and assassinated in 1204 at age 23 by his grandfather Hojo Tokimasa's soldiers. These tragic events mark Shuzenji as the historical end of the Minamoto clan's direct rule.

**Literary Significance:** The Izu Peninsula, including Shuzenji, holds deep literary significance as the setting for Kawabata Yasunari's semi-autobiographical short story "The Dancing Girl of Izu" (Izu no Odoriko, 1926). Kawabata spent extended periods in the nearby Yugashima area between 1924-1927 while writing the story, which features Shuzenji Onsen in the protagonist's journey. The work helped establish Kawabata's reputation and contributed to his 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature. Literary pilgrims still retrace the novella's route through the peninsula's forests, tunnels, and onsen villages.

**Wasabi Growing Region:** Shuzenji is positioned at the center of one of Japan's premiere wasabi growing areas, where pristine mountain streams provide ideal conditions for cultivating this prized ingredient. The town's restaurants serve the freshest wasabi in the world, often grated right before guests' eyes or provided as whole plants with stem-attached graters.
