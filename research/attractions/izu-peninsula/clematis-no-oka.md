Clematis no Oka (クレマチスの丘, "Clematis Hill") opened in April 2002 as a comprehensive art and nature resort with the theme of "Flowers, Art Museums, and Slow Food." [🔗](https://www.clematis-no-oka.co.jp) The complex spans a hillside location south of Mount Fuji and north of Suruga Bay, offering panoramic views of the Izu mountains to the southeast and Mount Fuji to the northwest. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJtrv0493-en/)

The facility comprises four distinct museums, extensive gardens featuring 200 varieties of clematis flowers, multiple dining establishments supervised by renowned chefs, museum stores, and nature parks scattered across the hillside property. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html) The complex represents a unique integration of world-class art collections, Japanese literature, architectural innovation, and natural beauty, making it one of Izu Peninsula's premier cultural destinations.

## The Four Museums

### Bernard Buffet Museum

The centerpiece of Clematis no Oka, the Bernard Buffet Museum opened on November 25, 1973, founded by banker Kiichiro Okano. [🔗](https://www.buffet-museum.jp/en/about/) The museum's distinctive architecture, reminiscent of a ship's sail, houses the world's largest collection of Bernard Buffet's works with approximately 2,000 pieces including oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, engravings, illustrated books, and posters spanning the French artist's lifetime. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100585/)

Bernard Buffet (1928-1999) was one of the most prominent artistic figures in post-war France, known for his exclusively figurative style often classified as Expressionist or "Miserabilist." [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Buffet) His work featured spiky, angular, and elongated forms rendered in somber color palettes that captured the emotional tristesse of post-war Paris. Though his fame in the 1950s rivaled Picasso's, changing artistic tastes led to declining popularity, with renewed interest emerging in the 21st century.

The museum complex includes the Buffet Children's Museum, a hands-on facility where children can experience art through a mini French kitchen model and dress as clowns featured in Buffet's paintings. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

### Vangi Sculpture Garden Museum

The Vangi Sculpture Garden Museum is the only museum in the world dedicated exclusively to the work of contemporary Italian figurative sculptor Giuliano Vangi (1931-2024). [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100575/) Vangi received the Praemium Imperiale in sculpture in 2002, considered the Nobel Prize of the arts, and is regarded as the greatest Italian contemporary figurative sculptor alongside masters like Arturo Martini, Giacomo Manzù, and Marino Marini. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Vangi)

Vangi's poetics focus on the human figure interpreted through powerful contemporary language while honoring great sculptural tradition. [🔗](https://www.finestresullarte.info/en/exhibitions/a-major-exhibition-pays-tribute-to-giuliano-vangi-in-cantu-one-year-after-the-sculptor-s-death) His work seeks to render contemporary humanity's anxiety and perplexity, reviving traditional inlay techniques using various colored marbles and metals to create polychromatic effects. His major works include statues for Florence Cathedral, Siena's "La Lupa," a crucifix and presbytery for Padua Cathedral, an altar for Pisa Cathedral, and the entrance sculpture for the Vatican Museum.

### Izu Photo Museum

The Izu Photo Museum opened in October 2009 as the newest addition to the complex, with interior and garden design by renowned photographer and contemporary artist Hiroshi Sugimoto. [🔗](https://www.buffet-museum.jp/en/izuphoto-museum/) The building was designed by Sugimoto's architectural firm, New Material Research Laboratory (Hiroshi Sugimoto + Tomoyuki Sakakida), and represents his symbolic signature architectural style. [🔗](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/izu-photo-museum-by-hiroshi-sugimoto/)

The museum's most striking feature is its stone chamber design, inspired by prehistoric Jomon sites and Kofun Period tumuli discovered in the vicinity. [🔗](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/izu-photo-museum-by-hiroshi-sugimoto/) Sugimoto selected several dozen two-ton stones and ten tons of flat stones, creating a stone chamber barely wide enough for a person to lie stretched out, with floor, walls, and ceiling all supporting each other stone on stone. [🔗](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/izu-photo-museum-by-hiroshi-sugimoto/)

The museum focuses on curating exhibitions exploring the historical and social conditions surrounding photography and film, two media that have evolved continually since the late nineteenth century. [🔗](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/izu-photo-museum-by-hiroshi-sugimoto/)

### Yasushi Inoue Literature Museum

The Yasushi Inoue Literature Museum (Nagaizumicho Inoue Yasushi Literature Museum) opened in 1973 alongside the Buffet Museum. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html) The museum displays approximately 3,000 items from the collection, including rare first editions, autographs, and Inoue's favorite fountain pens. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

Yasushi Inoue (1907-1991) was a renowned Japanese writer who won the 22nd Akutagawa Prize for "The Bullfight" and received the first Grand Prize of Japanese Literature for "Oroshiya Kokusui Mutan." [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html) His representative works include "Shirobamba," and many of his writings have been adapted into film, including "The Samurai Banner of Furinkazan." [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

## Gardens and Natural Setting

The Clematis Garden features approximately 200 species and varieties of clematis flowers that bloom at different times throughout the year. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html) Peak flowering occurs from May to June and August to September, but the gardens maintain year-round appeal with autumn colors from October and snow-capped mountain views in winter. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

The hillside location offers spectacular views overlooking the Izu mountains to the southeast and Mount Fuji to the northwest, with the natural scenery integrated into the museum experience through thoughtful landscape design.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**November Seasonal Considerations:**

**Weather:** November brings comfortable walking weather with autumn temperatures, ideal for outdoor exploration between museums. Expect cooler temperatures requiring light layers, especially given the hillside elevation. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Autumn Colors:** The gardens and surrounding hillside display autumn foliage from October onwards, providing scenic beauty even outside the clematis flowering season. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Mount Fuji Views:** November offers excellent visibility for snow-capped Mount Fuji views. Clear days provide spectacular photographic opportunities of Japan's iconic peak from the museum grounds. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

**Reduced Crowds:** November falls outside the peak clematis flowering season (May-June), resulting in significantly fewer visitors. This allows more intimate museum viewing experiences and easier access to popular installations. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Operating Hours:** November hours are 10:00 AM - 4:30 PM (last admission 4:00 PM), the shortest operating period of the year. Plan arrival by early-to-mid morning to maximize museum time. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Best Photo Spots:**
- Mount Fuji views from hillside gardens
- Bernard Buffet Museum sail-like architecture
- Vangi Sculpture Garden with mountain backgrounds
- Izu Photo Museum stone chamber architecture
- Photography policies: Check with museum staff regarding current photography policies for permanent and temporary exhibitions

**Crowd Avoidance:** November timing naturally avoids peak crowds (May-June clematis flowering). Prefer weekdays over weekends. Arrive shortly after 10:00 AM opening. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Money-Saving Options:**
- Purchase the all-museum pass for ¥3,000 rather than individual tickets
- Take advantage of reduced winter season admission rates (¥1,000 vs. ¥1,200 summer pricing)
- Student discounts: ¥500 November-March for high school/college students
- Free parking eliminates parking fees [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Museum Etiquette:**
- Follow standard Japanese museum etiquette - speak quietly, avoid touching artworks or display cases
- Turn off mobile phone sounds
- Some indoor spaces may require shoe removal
- Check for photography prohibition signs
- Dining reservations recommended, especially at Tessen (kaiseki dining): +81-55-989-8787 [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

**Weather Preparation:**
- Layered clothing for November (cool temperatures, especially early morning and late afternoon)
- Comfortable walking shoes for hillside terrain
- Clear weather maximizes Mount Fuji views
- Sun protection advisable for extended outdoor time [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Accessibility:** Contact the complex directly (+81-55-989-8787) to inquire about wheelchair accessibility, elevator access between buildings, and any limitations given the hillside terrain. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Nearby Attractions:**
- **Mishima City** (20 minutes): Mishima Taisha Shrine, Rakujuen Park, Genbe River with Mount Fuji snowmelt

**Integration with Izu Peninsula:** Clematis no Oka's location near Mishima makes it an excellent cultural complement to Izu Peninsula's predominantly natural and coastal attractions. Works well as a cultural stop contrasting with Izu's beaches, coastal drives, and seaside onsen towns, or en route between Izu Peninsula and Mount Fuji viewing points, Hakone, or Tokyo. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6305.html)

**Important Notes:**

**Transportation Limitation:** The discontinuation of the free shuttle bus significantly impacts accessibility for non-drivers. Budget approximately ¥3,000 for taxi service from Mishima Station, or carefully verify limited bus schedules before relying on public transportation. Car rental may be more economical for exploring multiple Izu destinations. [🔗](https://www.buffet-museum.jp/en/information/access/)

**Abbreviated November Hours:** With 4:30 PM closing (last admission 4:00 PM), the visiting window is significantly shorter than summer months. Arrive early to avoid feeling rushed. Attempting to see all four museums in-depth may require arriving at opening time. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Wednesday Closures:** Verify your visit dates do not fall on Wednesday (regular closure day) or year-end/New Year holidays. If Wednesday is a national holiday, the complex opens Wednesday but closes the following Thursday. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-2100575/)

**Seasonal Flower Timing:** November visitors will not see the clematis flowers in bloom (peak May-June and August-September). However, autumn foliage and Mount Fuji views provide compensating scenic beauty. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)

**Weather-Dependent Views:** Mount Fuji views depend entirely on weather conditions. November generally offers good visibility but cannot be guaranteed. [🔗](https://www.shift.jp.org/en/archives/2010/05/clematis_no_oka.html)

**Up-to-Date Information:** Check the official website (https://www.clematis-no-oka.co.jp) or call (+81-55-989-8787) before visiting to confirm current information, special exhibitions, and any temporary closures. [🔗](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/clematis-no-oka-art-complex/)
