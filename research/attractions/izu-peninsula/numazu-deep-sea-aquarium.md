The Numazu Deep Sea Aquarium (沼津港深海水族館 シーラカンス・ミュージアム) opened in December 2011 as the world's first museum centered exclusively on deep-sea species living more than 200 meters below the ocean surface. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/sports/diving/travel/numazu-deep-sea-aquarium/) Located at Numazu Port adjacent to Suruga Bay—Japan's deepest bay with a maximum depth of 2,500 meters—the aquarium's location provides unique access to one of the richest deep-sea ecosystems on Earth.

## Cultural & Scientific Significance

The aquarium is globally renowned for its Coelacanth Museum on the second floor, which houses the world's only frozen coelacanth specimens. The collection includes two frozen and three taxidermied specimens of this "living fossil" fish, which was thought to have gone extinct 66 million years ago until its rediscovery in 1938. The frozen specimens, kept at -20°C, were caught in 1981 by a Japanese research team and are classified as Class I under the Washington Convention, making them exceptionally rare scientific treasures.

Beyond the coelacanths, the aquarium showcases over 100 species of deep-sea creatures, with exhibits constantly changing based on what has been collected from Suruga Bay. The unique geographical conditions of the bay allow researchers to access deep-sea life that would be impossible to obtain elsewhere, creating a perpetually fresh and rare collection.

The Deep Sea Planetarium on the first floor offers a mesmerizing experience, featuring 150 bioluminescent lanterneye fish (Anomalopidae) glowing in a darkened, planetarium-like environment. This exhibit uses light and mirrors to showcase the natural bioluminescence of deep-sea creatures, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. [🔗](https://trip.numazukanko.jp/spot/10009)

## The Aquarium Experience

**First Floor - The Deep Sea Journey:**

The journey begins with a descent into the depths of Suruga Bay. The **Suruga Bay Large Tank** showcases local deep-sea inhabitants including the impressive Japanese spider crab with its massive leg span. The exhibit design mimics the progression from shallow to deep waters, introducing visitors to creatures adapted to extreme pressure and minimal light. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/sports/diving/travel/numazu-deep-sea-aquarium/)

The **Deep Sea Planetarium** creates an immersive experience where 150 bioluminescent lanterneye fish create natural light shows in complete darkness. This exhibit demonstrates how deep-sea creatures produce their own light for communication, hunting, and defense. [🔗](https://trip.numazukanko.jp/spot/10009)

Don't miss the **"Strange Creatures" corner**, which houses some of the most bizarre organisms from the deep sea, including giant isopods and other rarely exhibited species. The live deep-sea creature exhibits change frequently based on recent catches from Suruga Bay, offering unique viewing opportunities with each visit.

**Second Floor - Coelacanth Museum:**

The centerpiece of the museum, this floor is dedicated entirely to the coelacanth, a prehistoric fish thought extinct for 66 million years. The **frozen specimens**, visible through climate-controlled windows at -20°C, preserve every detail of scales, fins, eyes, and mouth—a sight available nowhere else on Earth.

Three additional taxidermied specimens provide different perspectives on this "living fossil," while educational displays detail the 1981 Japanese research expedition that obtained these specimens and the ongoing scientific significance of coelacanth research.

**Museum Shop:** Features deep-sea themed souvenirs, including toys, accessories, and confectionery unique to this aquarium. Perfect for educational gifts and unique mementos. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/sports/diving/travel/numazu-deep-sea-aquarium/)
