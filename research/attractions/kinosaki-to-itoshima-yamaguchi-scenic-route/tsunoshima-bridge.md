Tsunoshima Bridge (è§’å³¶å¤§æ©‹, Tsunoshima ÅŒhashi) is a breathtaking 1,780-meter bridge that connects Tsunoshima Island to mainland Shimonoseki across the Amagaseto Strait in the Sea of Japan. Opened on November 3, 2000, after seven years of construction at a cost of Â¥14.9 billion, it stands as the second-longest toll-free bridge to a remote island in Japan.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The bridge's distinctive curved shape was deliberately designed to preserve the natural environment of Hatoshima, demonstrating an environmentally-conscious approach that earned it the Excellence Award from the Japan Society of Civil Engineers in 2003. Its limited bridge height maintains the landscape's aesthetic integrity while providing one of Japan's most photogenic driving experiences. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunoshima_Bridge)

Tsunoshima Bridge has achieved legendary status as a filming location, frequently appearing in automobile commercials, television dramas, and movies due to its spectacular oceanscape and architectural beauty. [ðŸ”—](https://jl-db.nfaj.go.jp/en/location/350200015/) It was voted "Most Beautiful Bridge in Japan" on Trip Adviser and is recognized alongside nearby Motonosumi Inari Shrine, one of CNN's 31 Most Beautiful Places in Japan.

The bridge replaced a ferry service that operated seven daily round-trips but was frequently delayed by winter weather. Local residents advocated for the bridge's construction since 1983, and its completion transformed Tsunoshima from an isolated island into an accessible coastal paradise.
