*Traditional pottery wheel technique - pottery workshops in Hagi offer hands-on wheel throwing and hand-building experiences with 400-year-old ceramic traditions*

Hagi city is home to over 100 active pottery kilns continuing the 400-year tradition of Hagi-yaki (萩焼), one of Japan's most respected ceramic styles particularly valued in tea ceremony culture. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6157.html) The pottery tradition was established when Korean potters arrived in Hagi following the late 16th-century military campaigns, bringing advanced kiln technology including noborigama (climbing kilns) capable of reaching 1,400°C temperatures. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagi_ware)

Hagi-yaki is characterized by its subtle form, natural subdued colors, and distinctive kan-nyuu (貫入) crazing - a fine web of cracks that develops in the glaze after firing and cooling. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagi_ware) The warm neutral tones create a beautiful contrast with the bright green of matcha tea, making Hagi pottery highly prized for tea ceremony use.

The original pottery district was established in the Nakanokura section of Matsumoto village, east of Hagi Castle, where the Sakakōrai Zaemon workshop continues today. [🔗](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/hagi-ware-art-research-center-ritsumeikan-university/yQWxCfFpbqFQKA?hl=en) Many workshops throughout the historic district offer hands-on experiences, workshop tours, and opportunities to purchase authentic pieces directly from artisans.
