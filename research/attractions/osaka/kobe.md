Kobe is the capital city of Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan's seventh-largest city and third-largest port city after Tokyo and Yokohama, with a population of around 1.5 million. Located between the sea and the Rokko mountain range in the Kansai region, Kobe is one of Japan's most attractive cities, renowned for its cosmopolitan atmosphere, international heritage, and world-famous beef.

Visiting in November 2025 offers ideal conditions with favorable weather, fewer tourists, and peak fall foliage viewing at multiple scenic locations. [🔗](https://www.agatetravel.com/japan/kobe/weather-in-november.html)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Port City Heritage

Kobe has developed as a port city since ancient times due to its strategic position on the Seto Inland Sea. During the Nara Period (710-784 CE), the port, known as "Owada no Tomari," was already a major port of trade with China and other foreign countries. [🔗](https://cityofkobe.org/about-kobe/history/)

The city's defining moment came with the opening of the Port of Kobe on January 1, 1868, allowing Kobe to develop into an international port city after Japan's long period of isolation under the Tokugawa shogunate. Western food, clothes, and entertainment found their way into Japanese culture through foreign settlers, making Kobe one of the first cities in Japan to be introduced to foreign culture. The city is also known as the birthplace of jazz and cinema in Japan. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe)

The many foreigners who settled in Kobe in the 19th century gave it an international and cosmopolitan atmosphere that persists today. The city is recognized as a "Design City" by UNESCO and is widely associated with cosmopolitanism and fashion, encapsulated in the Japanese saying, "If you can't go to Paris, go to Kobe." [🔗](https://www.britannica.com/place/Osaka-Kobe-metropolitan-area/Kobe)

Today, Kobe is a cosmopolitan city, home to 1.5 million people from more than 130 countries, as well as global organizations and companies. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished some of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port. [🔗](https://kobe-convention.jp/en/practical-information/about-kobe/)

### The 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake and Recovery

The Great Hanshin earthquake struck on January 17, 1995, measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, causing significant destruction with over 6,400 fatalities, approximately 300,000 people homeless, and an estimated $100 billion in damages—one of the costliest natural disasters in history. [🔗](https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/insurance/1995-kobe-earthquake-reflecting-past-lessons-assessing-modern-resilience.html)

Twenty years after the earthquake, the infrastructure and buildings of Kobe have been rebuilt and revitalized through "creative recovery," rebuilding Kobe as a leading modern city rather than simply restoring what was lost. The earthquake catalyzed monumental recovery efforts and systemic improvements in Japan's disaster resilience, driving advances in building codes, seismic retrofitting, and emergency response systems. [🔗](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/1995-kobe-earthquake-reflecting-past-lessons-and-assessing-modern-resilience)

The tragedy led to a cultural shift regarding risk awareness, and in December 1995, the Japanese government established January 17 as 'Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day' to honor the victims and reinforce the nation's commitment to disaster preparedness. This event ultimately spurred Japan to become a global leader in disaster preparedness and resilience.

**JR Special Rapid Train (Recommended)**
JR special rapid trains on the JR Tokaido-Sanyo Line take 20-30 minutes from Osaka Station to Kobe's Sannomiya Station and cost ¥420 one way (covered by JR Pass and regional passes).

Kobe beef is Wagyu beef from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, raised in Japan's Hyōgo Prefecture around Kobe city. Tajima-gyu cows have maintained a pure bloodline since the Edo period (1615-1867), and Tajima cattle are considered "one of a kind" because they have maintained their pure bloodline without crossbreeding with cattle from other regions. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef)

Only about 3,000 cattle qualify as true Kobe beef each year, making it very rare and expensive. Kobe beef, characterized by its melt-in-your-mouth tenderness and refined sweetness, offers an unforgettable taste experience.
