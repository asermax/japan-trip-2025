Minoh Falls (Minoo Waterfall/箕面滝) is a 33-meter waterfall located in the Meiji no Mori Minō Quasi-National Park in northern Osaka Prefecture. This natural sanctuary, established as Japan's first municipal national park in 1898 and designated a Quasi-National Park in 1967, offers a peaceful escape into forested mountains just 30 minutes from central Osaka. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_no_Mori_Min%C5%8D_Quasi-National_Park) [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4019.html)

The area is renowned as one of Japan's premier autumn leaf viewing (koyo) destinations, with the Minoh River gorge's dense maple foliage attracting visitors since the early 18th century. [🔗](https://www.the-kansai-guide.com/en/directory/item/11449/) The park is equally famous for momiji tempura, a unique Osaka specialty of deep-fried maple leaves that has been sold along the trail since 1901.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The area holds profound significance in Japanese mountain Buddhism (Shugendo). Ryuan-ji Temple, located midway along the trail, was originally founded as Minoh-ji Temple in 650 CE by En no Gyoja (En the Ascetic), the legendary founder of Shugendo mountain worship. According to tradition, En no Gyoja was meditating near the waterfall when he received guidance from Benzaiten, one of the Seven Gods of Fortune, and carved a statue in her likeness - establishing what became Japan's oldest temple devoted to Benzaiten. [🔗](https://historyinpostcards.com/japan/84/) [🔗](https://trundlejapan.com/japan/osaka/minoo/ryuanji-temple/)

Throughout history, many famous monks followed in En the Ascetic's footsteps, including Kūkai, Hōnen, and Nichiren. At its peak, the temple complex had over 80 buildings scattered throughout the mountain. The temple's main gate was originally part of the Kyoto Imperial Palace and was relocated here in 1809 by Emperor Kokaku. [🔗](https://trundlejapan.com/japan/osaka/minoo/ryuanji-temple/) Ryuan Temple is also considered the birthplace of lottery practice in Japan, dating back to a 1575 ceremony called "tomikai" that raffled good luck charms to collect money for the temple. [🔗](https://www.japantripideas.com/en/kansai/osaka/minoo-park/ryuanji-temple)

The park's natural significance matches its cultural importance. As one of the smallest quasi-national parks in Japan at just 9.6 km², it serves as a remarkably biodiverse sanctuary. The area is famous as Japan's third-largest insect habitat with 3,500 species of insects, and the park contains approximately 1,300 species of trees. [🔗](https://www.the-kansai-guide.com/en/directory/item/11449/)

The tradition of momiji tempura began in 1901 when a souvenir shop called Momotaro opened along the hiking trail and started selling fried maple leaves. The production process is meticulous: during peak autumn colors (mid-November to early December), well-colored leaves are harvested by hand from specially cultivated Ichigyokaede maple trees, washed, and pickled in salt for at least one year before being coated in sweetened batter and deep-fried daily in vegetable oil.
