Dotonbori is Osaka's most vibrant entertainment district, running along the Dotonbori canal from Dotonboribashi Bridge to Nipponbashi Bridge in the Namba district. This area represents the heart of Osaka's identity as "Japan's Kitchen" and embodies the city's famous kuidaore philosophy - literally "eat yourself into financial ruin." [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/2207/)

Dotonbori traces its history back to 1612, when the administrator of local canals, Nariyasu Dōton, began construction of the canal on the southern edge of Osaka. Unfortunately, Doton was killed during the Siege of Osaka in 1615, and later that same year, Doton's cousins completed his work and in his memory the new canal was named Dotonbori or "Doton Canal." [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori)

The character of Dōtonbori became defined in 1621 when the Tokugawa Shogunate instituted urban planning and designated Dōtonbori as the entertainment district of Osaka. Within 50 years, the area expanded in popularity, boasting six kabuki and five bunraku (puppet) theaters - more than any other city in the empire. By the end of the 17th century, the north bank prospered with restaurants and teahouses that supplied food, drink and entertainment to theater goers.

Some 400 years later, this area is still an entertainment hub, attracting locals and travelers alike. Historically a theater district, it is now a popular nightlife and entertainment area characterized by its eccentric atmosphere and large illuminated signboards. The district is celebrated as the birthplace of bunraku, a form of traditional Japanese puppet theater renowned for its intricate storytelling and artistry, recognized as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

## Cultural & Food Significance

The district embodies the local kuidaore culture — the philosophy of eating until you go bankrupt. The term "kuidaore" is used to describe the food culture here, reflecting Dotonbori's synonymity with Osaka's reputation as "Japan's kitchen". The core of traditional foods in Osaka is mainly four flour-based dishes or konamono, called B-ranked foods because of their wallet-friendly prices, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and kitsune udon.

### Iconic Landmarks

**Glico Running Man Sign**
The most well-known landmark in Osaka, this huge, brightly lit sign has glowed over the Dotombori canal for more than 80 years. Dating back to 1935, the sign has had several overhauls and been altered to celebrate various sporting triumphs through the years. The current sign, recognized as the 6th generation, is the first to use LED technology. Since 1972 the huge neon has shown the Running Man on a running track with some of Osaka's best known landmarks like the Osaka Castle and the Tsutenkaku tower added to the background in 1998.

**Ebisu Bridge (Ebisubashi)**
The Ebisu Bridge below the Glico Running Man is a popular meeting place for both locals and tourists. In the evening and especially at weekends, the bridge is jam packed with people entering the Dotombori entertainment area. The southwest side of the bridge is a favorite photo spot due to the presence of the large Glico signboard. [🔗](https://www.planmyjapan.com/glico-running-man-dotonbori-osaka/)

**Kani Doraku Restaurant**
Walk the promenade to find the famous Kani Douraku restaurant, which prominently displays an enormous crab above its entrance. This six and a half meter crab is on the front of the crab restaurant Kani Dōraku and is mechanised, being able to move its arms and eyestalks. [🔗](https://digjapan.travel/en/featured/id=10900)

### Culinary Experiences

Takoyaki's history is rooted in Osaka, having been created there in the 1930's. Creamy, chewy and intensely flavorful, if you have to choose just one street food to try, takoyaki is a great choice. [🔗](https://www.byfood.com/blog/osaka/dotonbori-osaka)

**Hidden Gems:**

**Hozenji Temple & Hozenji Yokocho**
Hidden away in the backstreets of Dotonbori, this temple built in 1637 is best known for its moss-covered statue of the deity Fudo-myo-o (Mizukake Fudo). The statue is covered head to toe in moss, the result of many thousands of visitors pouring water over it for good luck. Hozenji Yokocho is the collective name of two 80-meter-long, less than 3-meter-wide east-west alleys running parallel to Dotonbori, with the temple at the western end. The dark alley is lit only by the traditional lanterns of the nearby restaurants which glow in the darkness, creating a unique atmosphere that contrasts with the bustling Dotonbori entertainment district. More than 60 restaurants and bars line either side. Approximately 5 minutes walk from Namba Station. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1109/)
