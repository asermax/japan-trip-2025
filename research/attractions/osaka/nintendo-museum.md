The Nintendo Museum (ãƒ‹ãƒ³ãƒ†ãƒ³ãƒ‰ãƒ¼ãƒŸãƒ¥ãƒ¼ã‚¸ã‚¢ãƒ ) is the world's first museum dedicated to Nintendo's 135+ year history, housed in the former Nintendo Uji Ogura Plant where the company historically manufactured Hanafuda playing cards and repaired consoles. [ðŸ”—](https://museum.nintendo.com/en/index.html) Opened on October 2, 2024, the museum offers a comprehensive journey through Nintendo's evolution from a playing card manufacturer in 1889 to a global video game leader, featuring both historical galleries and interactive exhibits. Located in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, the museum sits 60-90 minutes from Osaka via JR train lines. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Museum)

The museum is dedicated to showcasing Nintendo's extensive history with historical product galleries featuring Hanafuda cards, 1960s-70s toys, Game & Watch devices, and early consoles, plus extensive console collections spanning Nintendo's gaming history and over 80 classic games playable on original hardware. [ðŸ”—](https://www.leafkyoto.net/en/241004-kyoto-nintendo/) Exclusive merchandise and a themed cafÃ© experience complete the visit, with interactive Hanafuda card-making workshops offering hands-on cultural engagement.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**Corporate Heritage Site**

The museum's location holds deep significance as the former Uji Ogura Plant where Nintendo manufactured its foundational products. The choice to preserve and transform this industrial facility into a museum demonstrates Nintendo's commitment to honoring its heritage while celebrating its transformation from a traditional Japanese craft business into a global entertainment company. The building itself embodies over a century of Japanese manufacturing history and the company's evolution through multiple eras of technological and cultural change.

**Hanafuda Cultural Context**

Nintendo's origins as a Hanafuda (flower card) manufacturer in 1889 connects the museum to centuries-old Japanese gaming traditions. Hanafuda cards represent one of Japan's oldest card game traditions, developed during the Edo period when Western playing cards were banned. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafuda) The museum's emphasis on Hanafudaâ€”including historical displays, playable games, and card-making workshopsâ€”preserves this cultural heritage while demonstrating how traditional Japanese craftsmanship laid the foundation for Nintendo's future innovation in electronic gaming.

**Gaming History Documentation**

The museum serves as a comprehensive archive documenting the evolution of video gaming through Nintendo's lens. From the revolutionary Game & Watch handheld devices that pioneered portable gaming to the Famicom/NES that revitalized the North American video game industry after the 1983 crash, the exhibits chronicle pivotal moments in gaming history. The ability to play over 80 classic games on original hardware offers visitors authentic experiences of gaming's technological evolutionâ€”something increasingly rare as original hardware becomes obsolete.
