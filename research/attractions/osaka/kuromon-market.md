Kuromon Market dates back nearly 200 years to the Edo Period (1603-1868), making it one of the oldest surviving markets in Japan. The market in its current form was officially established in 1902 with the name Enmyoji Ichiba, but quickly gained the nickname Kuromon Ichiba - "Black Gate Market" - derived from a black-painted gate of Enmyōji Temple where fish merchants began gathering in the late Edo period. Although the temple was completely destroyed by fire in the early 20th century, the market's name persists today. [🔗](https://shun-gate.com/en/roots/roots_24/)

After World War II devastated much of Osaka, Kuromon Market made a remarkable recovery and became an important hub for food supply in the post-war period. Through word of mouth, the market has become known not only within Japan but also throughout the world as the place to meet real Osaka merchants.

The market earned its distinctive nickname "Osaka's Kitchen" thanks to around 150 vendors covering fresh fish, produce, meat, pickles, dried goods, and more, stretching approximately 600 meters parallel to Sakaisujidori Street in the Minami area of Osaka. Chefs from local sushi restaurants and even Michelin-starred establishments visit daily to source ingredients, while regular locals continue their traditional shopping here.
