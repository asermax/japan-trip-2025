Shinsekai (新世界, meaning "New World") is a vibrant retro entertainment district in Osaka's Naniwa Ward, developed in 1912 and inspired by both Paris and New York's Coney Island. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsekai) The district centers around the iconic Tsutenkaku Tower and has retained its nostalgic Showa-era atmosphere, making it one of Osaka's most authentic downtown experiences. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4012.html)

Shinsekai was created following the success of the 1903 National Industrial Exposition, which brought over five million people to the neighborhood. The district was developed in 1912 with the vision of creating a new tourist hub, with its northern half modeled after Paris and the southern portion built to imitate Coney Island in New York. [🔗](https://www.osakastation.com/shinsekai-and-the-tsutenkaku-tower/)

At the heart of this district was Luna Park amusement park, which operated from 1912 to 1923 and featured mechanical rides, an amusement arcade, a music hall, and a hot spring spa. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsekai) The original Tsutenkaku Tower was constructed in 1912 after Paris' Eiffel Tower, standing 64 meters high and ranking as the second biggest structure in Asia at the time. Although it was scrapped during WWII, local people campaigned for a new tower and the current structure was built in 1956, standing at 103 meters tall and designed by architect Tachu Naito, who also designed Tokyo Tower. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4012.html)

Today, Shinsekai remains true to its retro roots, with streets lined with traditional eateries, old-school shops, and colorful neon signs creating a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of old Osaka. [🔗](https://flipjapanguide.com/osaka-shinsekai/) The district is the birthplace of Osaka's iconic kushikatsu (deep-fried skewers) and embodies the city's "kuidaore" (eat yourself broke) philosophy.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Tsutenkaku Tower (通天閣)

The iconic 103-meter tower is Osaka's symbol and the heart of Shinsekai. The main observatory at 91 meters offers sweeping urban vistas of Osaka. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kinki/osaka/osaka-osaka/shinsekaikanko/) The 5th floor houses the "Golden Observation Deck" adorned in gold, along with the famous Billiken statue - a good luck deity where visitors throw coins into a collection box, rub his feet, and make wishes. [🔗](https://www.osaka.com/info/osaka-history/billiken-the-unofficial-mascot-of-osaka/) The Billiken originates from Kansas City, Missouri (created in 1908), but has become deeply integrated into Osaka culture since 1912. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/plan-your-trip/to-know/traveling-japan/billiken-osaka)

At night, Tsutenkaku is beautifully illuminated with dazzling lights that perfectly complement the vibrant Shinsekai atmosphere, making it an ideal spot for photos. [🔗](https://www.japan-travel-note.com/posts/494)

### Kushikatsu Culture

Shinsekai is the birthplace of kushikatsu, Osaka's iconic deep-fried skewers that originated around 1930 as an affordable, nutritious meal for workers. [🔗](https://www.osakalocalized.com/post/shinsekai-food-guide-where-and-what-to-eat-in-shinsekai-osaka) Kushikatsu is distinguished by its light, crunchy panko bread crumbs bound together with egg and a little flour. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/kushikatsu-perfect-guide-the-deep-fried-skewers-loved-in-osaka/)

**The Golden Rule - No Double-Dipping:** Most kushikatsu restaurants offer a large communal container of savory, tangy dipping sauce meant to be shared by all diners, so double-dipping is strictly prohibited for hygiene reasons and to prevent the sauce from spoiling. [🔗](https://visitinsidejapan.com/restaurants-in-japan/mastering-kushikatsu-etiquette-and-how-to-eat/) If you want more sauce, use the cabbage provided at the table - scoop some sauce with a leaf and drizzle it over your skewer. [🔗](https://visitinsidejapan.com/restaurants-in-japan/mastering-kushikatsu-etiquette-and-how-to-eat/)

**Proper Eating Technique:** Hold the skewer and eat directly from the top - it's considered improper to remove food from the skewer. [🔗](https://livinginjapan.net/2019/09/00343/) The recommendation is to dip 70-80% of the ingredients in sauce so you can taste the part of the batter without sauce, enhancing the flavor of the ingredients.

## The Experience

### Janjan Yokocho (ジャンジャン横丁)

This narrow 130-meter alley lined with about 50 shops is the beating heart of Shinsekai's food culture. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kinki/osaka/osaka-osaka/shinsekaikanko/) The street structure is about 180 meters long and just 2.5 meters wide, creating an intimate, bustling atmosphere. [🔗](https://airial.travel/attractions/japan/osaka/janjan-yokocho-osaka-G-PkpfKX)

Visitors describe the alley's incredibly vibrant and nostalgic atmosphere, especially at night with dazzling neon lights. The street features mini archery, old-school arcades, and all kinds of food and bars. [🔗](https://airial.travel/attractions/japan/osaka/janjan-yokocho-osaka-G-PkpfKX) Walking through Janjan Yokocho, you'll smell the aroma of local specialties like kushikatsu, doteyaki (beef tendon stewed in miso), and horumon-yaki (grilled offal). [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/jan-jan-yokocho-alley-in-osaka-food-guide-in-nanyo-dori-shotengai/)

### Famous Kushikatsu Restaurants

- **Kushikatsu Daruma** (だるま) - Established in 1929, the original main store has only 12 counter seats, creating an intimate experience. Located at 3-4-4 Ebisu-higashi, Naniwa-ku. Hours: 11:00 AM - 9:00 PM. Daruma operates four distinct branches in Shinsekai, each offering unique menus and seating arrangements. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/11883/)

- **Yaekatsu** - Popular for both kushikatsu and the "3-piece doteyaki set" (beef tendon simmered in miso for 8-10 hours), though expect long lines. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kinki/osaka/osaka-osaka/kushikatsu/)

### Standing Bar (Tachinomi) Culture

Shinsekai is vibrant with izakayas where you can enjoy delicious drinks and food at reasonable prices, including popular standing drinking culture establishments and "senbero" spots where you can get drunk for around ¥1,000. [🔗](https://www.magical-trip.com/media/osakas-hidden-drinking-districts-bar-guide-2024-ultimate-nightlife-spots-for-bar-hopping/)

Standing bars typically have a homey atmosphere popular with locals, with menus that change slightly every day reflecting the owner's personal taste. The sight of local regulars and tourists enjoying food and drinks shoulder to shoulder is truly emblematic of Osaka culture. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kinki/osaka/osaka-osaka/shinsekai-izakaya/)

**"Nishinari Morning" Experience:** A unique breakfast menu where you can enjoy a three-item set of one drink (beer, shochu, highball), a boiled egg, and a small side dish of the day, all for just ¥350. Famous izakayas in Nishinari Ward open every morning at 9:00 AM to serve this unique breakfast experience. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/kinki/osaka/osaka-osaka/shinsekai-izakaya/)

### Smart Ball Arcade - "New Star"

Smart Ball Game Store "New Star" is a hidden gem offering retro Showa-era gaming. Smart ball originated in Europe in the 1700s and was popular during Japan's Showa era - it's similar to pinball without flippers, combined with pachinko-style prize elements. [🔗](https://yoshinomad.com/en/smartball-new-star/)

**How to Play:** Insert a ¥100 coin to receive 25 small blue balls. Pull back the stick to launch balls, aiming for holes on the table. When a ball gets in a hole, the same number of balls as written on that hole will come out. You can exchange balls for different prizes (not for money). [🔗](https://yoshinomad.com/en/smartball-new-star/)

The retro Showa-style hall is filled with old-fashioned smartball machines lined up in rows. There are only a few places in Japan where you can play smart ball, making this shop particularly valuable for experiencing vintage analog gaming culture. [🔗](https://www.japan-travel-note.com/posts/379)
