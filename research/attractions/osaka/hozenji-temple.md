Hozenji Temple (Hozen-ji) is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo-shu (Pure Land) sect located in Osaka's Dotonbori district, founded in 1637. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dzen-ji_(Osaka)) The temple is renowned for its moss-covered Fudo Myoo statue, affectionately known as "Mizukake Fudo" (water-splashing Fudo), which has become entirely covered in lush green moss due to the traditional practice of worshippers splashing water over it. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1109/)

The temple is tucked away in the atmospheric Hozenji Yokocho alley, an 80-meter-long, 3-meter-wide stone-paved passageway that offers a serene escape from the neon-lit chaos of Dotonbori. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-travel-note.com/posts/476/) It is the only historic structure in the area to have survived the bombings of World War II.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Hozenji Temple dates back to 1637 and has developed a rich history intertwined with Osaka's merchant culture. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dzen-ji_(Osaka)) The area initially developed from street vendors serving audiences attending Kamigata Rakugo performances at the theater within Hozenji Temple grounds, which over time grew into today's Hozenji Yokocho. [ðŸ”—](https://www.howto-osaka.com/en/features/features124/)

During the Taisho period, writers like Sakunosuke Oda and Koen Hasegawa used it as the setting for their novels, making the name "Hozenji Yokocho" known nationwide. [ðŸ”—](https://www.howto-osaka.com/en/features/features124/) Most of it was destroyed in the Osaka air raids at the end of the Pacific War in 1945, but remarkably, the Fudo Myoo statue survived, making it the only historic structure in the area to survive World War II bombings. [ðŸ”—](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fudo-myo-o-statue)

The temple pays homage to Fudo Myoo (Fudo Myo-o), one of the five Wisdom Kings in Japanese Buddhism. [ðŸ”—](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/14647/) Fudo Myoo means "the immovable wisdom king," because he battles evil with immovable faith and compassion, using self-control to be free from suffering. [ðŸ”—](https://www.planmyjapan.com/hozenji-temple-osaka-guide/)

Wielding a sword and rope, Fudo Myoo embodies the Buddhist concept of overcoming ignorance with enlightenment. [ðŸ”—](https://www.osaka.com/thingstodo/attractions/a-brief-history-of-hozenji-minamis-24-hour-power-spot/) The deity serves as a guardian of Buddhism and, more specifically, the Five Wisdom Buddhas. Fudo Myo-o's cultural significance extends beyond religious devotion, deeply influencing Japanese art forms like ukiyo-e and Irezumi. [ðŸ”—](https://www.osaka.com/thingstodo/attractions/a-brief-history-of-hozenji-minamis-24-hour-power-spot/)

### The Moss-Covered Statue Phenomenon

The moss-covered statues and warmly lit stone-paved alleys did not emerge until after World War II, when air raids burned the surrounding area except for the Fudo Myo-o statue. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dzen-ji_(Osaka)) The moss makes it look like this is an ancient custom, but it is said to be recent, initiated after World War II by a local woman who regularly visited the shrine. [ðŸ”—](https://www.planmyjapan.com/hozenji-temple-osaka-guide/)

The practice earned the statue the nickname "Mizukake" ("water splashing") Fudo. [ðŸ”—](https://www.planmyjapan.com/hozenji-temple-osaka-guide/) When worshippers visit the Hozenji temple and pray to the Fudo Myo-o statue, most visitors use one of the small water buckets and splash the statue with water. Given the alleyway location (which is often quite dark), it has created optimum conditions for the moss to grow. [ðŸ”—](https://www.planmyjapan.com/hozenji-temple-osaka-guide/) Many years of moisture from this practice have caused moss to cover the statue entirely, making it blanketed by a soft, green carpet of lush and vivid green thick moss.
