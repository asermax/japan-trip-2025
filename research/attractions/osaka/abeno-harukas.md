Abeno Harukas is a 300-meter tall skyscraper that served as Japan's tallest building from its completion in 2014 until 2023, when Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower surpassed it. The name "Harukas" derives from the old Japanese expression "harukasu," meaning "to brighten" or "to clear up," reflecting the building's purpose to invigorate the Tennoji-Abeno district. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeno_Harukas)

Construction began in January 2010, initially without the intention to build Japan's tallest structure. However, when regulations for Osaka International (Itami) Airport were eased in March 2007, plans were revised to surpass Yokohama Landmark Tower. The building officially opened on March 7, 2014, designed by renowned architect CÃ©sar Pelli. [ðŸ”—](https://www.nippon.com/en/guide-to-japan/gu900113/)

The building serves as a multi-functional cultural hub containing the Harukas 300 Observatory (floors 58-60) with panoramic 360-degree views, Kintetsu Department Store (basement 2 through floor 14), Abeno Harukas Art Museum (floor 16), Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel (floors 19-57), and Harukas Dining (floors 12-14).

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The location holds historical significance within Osaka's urban fabric. The Abeno district has roots dating to the Edo period (17th-19th century), when it housed traditional Japanese gardens, temples, and shrines. Abeno Harukas represents the modernization of this historic area, symbolizing Osaka's economic prosperity and growth as a major metropolitan center. [ðŸ”—](https://insideosaka.com/harukas/)

The building's design by internationally acclaimed architect CÃ©sar Pelli places it among significant global architectural achievements. Its height record (Japan's tallest from 2014-2023) marked a milestone in Japanese urban development and showcases contemporary engineering capabilities. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeno_Harukas)

The multi-functional nature of the building - combining observation deck, shopping, art museum, hotel, and dining - reflects Japanese urban planning philosophy of maximizing vertical space efficiency while creating comprehensive lifestyle destinations that serve multiple community needs within a single structure.
