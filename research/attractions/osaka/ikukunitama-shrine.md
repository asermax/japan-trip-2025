## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Ancient Origins and Historical Significance

Originally located near present-day Osaka Castle, the shrine was razed to the ground during the battle of Ishiyama in 1580. In 1585, Toyotomi Hideyoshi relocated the shrine to its current location when he built Osaka Castle.
