**Time Allocation**

Budget minimum 3-4 hours for thorough Akihabara exploration. Serious collectors and enthusiasts can easily spend full day covering major shops, themed cafes, and arcades.

**Shopping Strategy**

Start with major retailers (Animate, Gamers) for comprehensive selection of current releases. Visit Mandarake for secondhand and rare items at better prices. Check Radio Kaikan for figures and specialty items.

Compare prices between shops before purchasingâ€”the same item often appears at different locations with varying prices. Mandarake generally offers best prices for pre-owned items.

**Combining Experiences**

Alternate shopping with themed cafe breaks (Gundam Cafe) and arcade gaming to avoid shopping fatigue. The district's compact size allows easy movement between different activity types.

**Best Days**

Tuesday-Thursday offer best combination of shop availability and manageable crowds. Avoid Saturdays (peak tourism) and major product release dates (check anime news sites).

**Luggage**

Use coin lockers at Akihabara Station for large bagsâ€”shopping creates package accumulation. Many shops offer to hold purchases for later same-day pickup.
