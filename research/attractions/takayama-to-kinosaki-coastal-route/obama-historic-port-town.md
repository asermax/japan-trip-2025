Obama is a historic port town in Fukui Prefecture that served as the starting point of the legendary Saba Kaido (Mackerel Road), a network of routes developed around the eighth century to transport mackerel and other goods from the ancient province of Wakasa to Kyoto. [ðŸ”—](https://www1.city.obama.fukui.jp/japan_heritage/story/index.php?lang=EN&id=2) Over the years, Obama became a bustling castle town, and as maritime transport became more widespread around the end of the twelfth century, Obama's significance as a port town grew.

Since ancient times, the Saba Kaido was a thoroughfare by which goods, culture, and technology arrived in Nara and Kyoto from the Asian mainland, and where the refined culture of the capital made its way back to the port town of Obama. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/saba-kaido/) This helped shape Obama's culture, which retains tangible influences from Kyoto to this day. Architectural styles originating in Kyoto are preserved in the old teahouses and geisha houses of the Obamanishigumi Preservation District, while Kyoto's Gion Festival is believed to have influenced Obama's Hoze Festival.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

From about 738, the fame of Obama's quality seafood, specifically mackerel, had been escalating until it caught the attention of the Royal Court at Kyoto, who then bestowed the miketsukuni title on Obama making them Royal Purveyors of saba to the Royal Family. [ðŸ”—](https://en.japantravel.com/fukui/obama-s-food-culture-museum/70531) In the Edo period, merchants began shipping large quantities of mackerel to Kyoto, and salted it in Obama to keep it fresh. [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJtrvpr0066-en/)

The freshly caught saba was prepared and packed first thing in the morning, then transported by foot up a steep mountain top to reach Kyoto the next morning. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1021154-d8090053-Reviews-Saba_Kaido_Museum-Obama_Fukui_Prefecture_Hokuriku_Chubu.html) This remarkable feat - delivering seafood from the Sea of Japan to the ancient capital while maintaining freshness - established Obama's legendary status in Japanese culinary history.

The town's designation as an Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings protects iconic Japanese architecture from as early as the Meiji period (1868-1912), creating a living museum of port town culture that bridges mountain and coastal Japan.
