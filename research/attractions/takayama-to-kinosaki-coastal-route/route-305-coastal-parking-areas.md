Route 305 (国道305号) is a scenic coastal highway running approximately 70km along the Echizen Coast in Fukui Prefecture, from Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture to Minamiechizen Town. The route passes through the Echizen-Kaga Kaigan Quasi-National Park, designated in 1968 for its strikingly oddly shaped rocks and scenic coastal features.

The highway runs along most of the coastline with few obstacles like high seawalls, allowing drivers to enjoy continuous views of the Sea of Japan. Multiple parking areas are strategically located along Route 305 where drivers can stop near the most scenic spots, allowing visitors to get out and fully enjoy the scenery that nature has created over time.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Route 305 provides a scenic coastal driving experience along the Echizen-Kaga Kaigan Quasi-National Park, a protected landscape spanning 9,246 hectares of coastal areas in Fukui and Ishikawa Prefectures. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echizen-Kaga_Kaigan_Quasi-National_Park)

The Echizen Coast stretches from Tojinbo in the north to Sugitsu in Tsuruga in the south, characterized by magnificent cliffs and strange rocks created by an uplifted coastline. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-3800044/) The Shiokaze Line and National Route 305 serve as the stage for this coastal drive, tracing picturesque Japanese fishing villages and coastal scenic spots including notable rock formations like Kochomon.

The route showcases the dramatic geological formations sculpted by the rough waves of the Japan Sea, with rare types of rock formations visible along the road which runs right next to the water. [🔗](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/5352856/echizen-coast)

The Echizen Coast represents an important part of Fukui's maritime heritage, with traditional fishing villages that have existed for centuries along the Sea of Japan corridor. The area is designated as a Quasi-National Park (IUCN Category V protected landscape/seascape), recognizing its scenic and cultural significance. The geological features visible from Route 305 parking areas represent millions of years of coastal erosion and uplift, creating educational opportunities for understanding Japan's dynamic coastal geology.

Kochomon (呼鳥門), literally meaning "Inviting Birds Gate," is a natural rock arch eroded by winds and waves over countless years into the shape of a gate.

- High-pressure systems frequent in late October, bringing clear skies and crisp air
- Early October may experience residual typhoon effects, but late October (26th) typically clear
- Cold northwesterly winds increase by November; October remains comfortable for coastal driving
- Sea of Japan coastal areas experience clearer conditions before winter storm season begins

**Photography Conditions:**

- Parking areas at major viewpoints (Kochomon, Echizen Cape) may fill during favorable weather
- Early morning or late afternoon offers quieter viewing opportunities

### Driving Considerations

**Route Experience:**

**Safety Tips:**
- Kochomon natural arch OFF-LIMITS for passing through; viewing from distance only (falling rock danger) [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/fukui/kocho-gate-and-guano-rock/17528)
- Coastal cliff edges lack barriers in some areas; maintain safe distance from drop-offs
- Road runs very close to water in sections; avoid stopping on roadway; use designated parking only
- Strong winds possible along exposed coastal sections; secure vehicle doors when opening

### Route Integration

**Route Context:** Route 305 coastal parking areas serve as ON-ROUTE stops during the Takayama to Kinosaki Onsen journey (October 26, 2025). The coastal scenic route extends the drive time but prioritizes dramatic Sea of Japan scenery and traditional fishing village atmosphere over expressway efficiency.

**Journey Flow:**
- **Before Route 305:** Central Fukui mountain routes, potential pottery/craft stops in Echizen area
- **Route 305 Coastal Drive:** 70km scenic coastal highway with multiple parking area viewpoints (2-3 hours with stops)
- **After Route 305:** Continue north along San-in Coast through Tottori/Hyogo prefectures toward Kinosaki Onsen

**Complementary Route Stops:**
- Route 305 parking areas pair well with cultural stops at Echizen pottery/knife workshops (adds Echizen cultural heritage context)
- Michi-no-Eki Kono provides practical facilities break between mountain and coastal driving sections
- Echizen Cape Observation Deck offers elevated perspective complementing sea-level viewpoints

**Strategic Timing:**
- Schedule Route 305 drive for afternoon to take advantage of late October sunset timing (5:00-5:30 PM)
- Multiple short stops (5-15 minutes each) maintain driving momentum while capturing coastal highlights
- Extended stop at Echizen Cape or Kochomon for 30+ minutes provides rest break and major photo opportunity

### Cultural Etiquette

- Park only in designated areas; avoid blocking road shoulders on narrow sections
- Take all trash with you; limited waste facilities at remote pullouts
- Respect safety barriers near cliff edges and dangerous rock formations
- Keep noise levels low at scenic viewpoints out of respect for other visitors
- Photography permitted throughout; no flash needed for daytime coastal shots
