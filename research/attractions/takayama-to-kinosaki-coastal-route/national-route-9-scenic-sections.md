National Route 9 (国道9号, Kokudō Kyū-gō) is Japan's second-longest national highway at 638.4 kilometers, offering one of the most dramatic coastal driving experiences along the Sea of Japan. The route connects the prefectural capitals of Kyoto, Tottori, Matsue (Shimane Prefecture), and Yamaguchi across the Kansai and Chūgoku regions.

The most scenic sections traverse the San-in Coast UNESCO Global Geopark, extending approximately 120 kilometers across Kyoto, Hyogo, and Tottori prefectures. This designated geopark area features a dramatic ria coastline where mountains meet the Sea of Japan directly, creating a landscape of sea cliffs, caves, and unique rock formations carved by marine erosion and seasonal winds.

The coastal sections of Route 9 through Fukui Prefecture feature "constant changes between stone cliffs and lush greenery," with an "eclectic range of rock formations" where travelers can experience "a completely new coloration or structure" within just a few meters of driving.

This route has been historically significant as a traditional maritime corridor connecting mountain cultures of the interior with coastal fishing traditions, showcasing the region's Echizen cultural heritage including pottery and knife-making traditions alongside coastal pilgrimage paths.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The San-in coastline offers a less-touristed alternative to Japan's Pacific coast, providing an authentic experience of the country's Sea of Japan maritime culture. The scenic drive from Fukui through Tottori to Hyogo "snakes between dense forests and a sparsely populated coastline," passing traditional fishing villages, dramatic geological formations, and Japan's only large dune system at Tottori.

The San-in Coast UNESCO Global Geopark designation recognizes the dramatic coastal geology shaped by the Sea of Japan and the unique way of life that has evolved in harmony with this challenging environment. The coastal communities demonstrate how villages have adapted to and thrived along this dynamic coastline for centuries. [🔗](https://www.the-kansai-guide.com/en/exciting/01/)

As Japan's second-longest national highway, Route 9 serves as the primary transportation artery along the San-in (northern) coast of western Honshu, connecting mountain Hida culture with coastal fishing traditions.
