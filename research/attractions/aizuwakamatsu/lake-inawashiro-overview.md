Lake Inawashiro (猪苗代湖), also known as "Heavenly Mirror Lake" (Tenkyōko/天鏡湖), is Japan's fourth-largest lake, located in central Fukushima Prefecture within the borders of Bandai-Asahi National Park. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1743/) The lake earned its poetic name due to its exceptionally clear, acidic waters (pH ~5.0) that provide stunning reflections of the surrounding landscapes, particularly Mount Bandai to the north. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Inawashiro)

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Surface area: 104 square kilometers (40 sq mi)
- Circumference: 63 kilometers (39 mi)
- Maximum depth: 94 meters (308 ft)
- Altitude: 514 meters (1,686 ft)
- Water transparency: Exceptionally high due to acidic composition

Lake Inawashiro represents a stunning convergence of natural beauty, geological history, and cultural significance in Japan's Tohoku region. Formed 30,000-50,000 years ago when a tectonic depression was dammed by a major eruption and pyroclastic flow from Mount Bandai, the lake has evolved into one of Japan's most scenic natural landmarks. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Inawashiro)

The lake's defining characteristic is its exceptional water clarity and acidic composition, which create the mirror-like reflections that inspired its traditional Japanese name. These pristine waters so impressed Imperial Prince Arisugawa Takehito during his visit to the Tohoku District that he commissioned the construction of Tenkyokaku villa (1907), named "The Palace of Heaven's Mirror" by Crown Prince Yoshihito. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Inawashiro)

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, Lake Inawashiro played a crucial role in regional development through the Asaka Sosui canal system, completed as the Meiji government's first national infrastructure project. This 127-kilometer canal drew lake water to Koriyama, transforming the agricultural landscape and demonstrating the lake's economic significance to Fukushima's modern development. [🔗](https://matcha-jp.com/en/20711)

The lake achieved international recognition for its ecological importance when it was designated as a Ramsar Convention wetland on July 15, 2025, becoming Japan's 54th registered wetland and Fukushima's second. [🔗](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lake-inawashiro-in-fukushima-prefecture-registered-as-wetlands-under-ramsar-convention-302535254.html) The 10,960-hectare designated area supports 197 species of fauna, including 111 bird species, with particular significance as a wintering ground for tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). The swans and their migratory grounds are designated as natural monuments of Japan. [🔗](https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2574)

## Cultural & Ecological Significance

**Ramsar Wetland Designation:**
As of July 15, 2025, Lake Inawashiro is newly designated as an internationally important wetland under the Ramsar Convention. This recognition brings enhanced conservation protections while promoting "wise use" of the ecosystem. The designation acknowledges the lake's critical role as a wintering habitat for over 3,000 tundra swans and 111 bird species. [🔗](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lake-inawashiro-in-fukushima-prefecture-registered-as-wetlands-under-ramsar-convention-302535254.html)

**Swan Migration:**
Over 3,000 tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) migrate to Lake Inawashiro annually, arriving in October and remaining through April. The lake's significant depth prevents complete freezing in winter, making it an ideal overwintering site. The swans and their migratory grounds are designated as natural monuments of Japan. [🔗](https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2574/)

**Historical Significance:**
The lake's clear waters impressed Imperial Prince Arisugawa Takehito so profoundly during his visit to the Tohoku District that he commissioned Tenkyokaku villa (1907), named "The Palace of Heaven's Mirror" by Crown Prince Yoshihito. This imperial connection elevated the lake's cultural status beyond its natural beauty. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Inawashiro)

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Seasonal Considerations for October-November:**

*Autumn Foliage Timing:*
Peak foliage season runs from mid-October through early November, with beech, maple, and larch trees creating spectacular color displays around the lake and on Mount Bandai's slopes. Nakatsugawa Valley reaches peak color mid-October to early November. [🔗](https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/guide/area/hokkaidotohoku/fukushima/fukushima-koyo2019/)

*Swan Arrival:*
