The Goshikinuma ("Five Colored Ponds") is a cluster of volcanic lakes situated at the foot of Mount Bandai in the Bandai-Asahi National Park. These lakes formed when Mount Bandai erupted on July 15, 1888, in a catastrophic event that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 500 people while creating hundreds of lakes and tarns. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshiki-numa)

The eruption completely rearranged the landscape, with approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of the summit collapsing and flowing northwards. The deposition of debris created the distinctive topography of Urabandai, a land dotted with innumerable small hills and valleys. As water accumulated in the low-lying areas, many small lakes and marshes, including the Goshikinuma, took form.

While the name suggests five ponds, the trail actually connects over 40 ponds and lakes. The eight main lakes are Bishamonnuma, Akanuma, Midoronuma, Tatsunuma, Aonuma, Bentennuma, Yanaginuma, and Rurinuma, each displaying unique hues ranging from emerald green to cobalt blue to rusty red. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/five-coloured-lakes-japan-goshikinuma/) These colors mysteriously fluctuate throughout the year with weather, season, viewing angle, and time of day, making each visit a unique experience. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshiki-numa)

## Color Formation Science

The eruption forced acidic substances into the groundwater that flowed into the ponds, and these acids chemically changed into aluminum silicate crystals and mixed into the water. The crystals reflect specific wavelengths of light creating the mysterious colors seen in the ponds.
