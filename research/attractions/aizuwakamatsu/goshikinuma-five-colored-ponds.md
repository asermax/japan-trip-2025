Goshikinuma (五色沼, "Five-Colored Ponds") is a cluster of approximately 20-30 volcanic crater lakes located in the Urabandai Highland at the foot of Mount Bandai in Fukushima Prefecture. Created by the catastrophic 1888 eruption of Mount Bandai, these ponds display a stunning array of colors ranging from emerald green to cobalt blue, turquoise, and pastel blue due to volcanic minerals in the water. The area is part of Bandai-Asahi National Park and features an accessible 3.6-4km nature trail that takes visitors past the most spectacular ponds.

## Volcanic Formation and Geological History

On July 15, 1888, Mount Bandai erupted in one of Japan's most devastating volcanic events, destroying dozens of villages and killing approximately 500 people. The massive eruption sent tons of volcanic debris cascading down the mountain's northern slopes, and as this material settled, it dammed several valleys creating the distinctive topography of Urabandai - a landscape dotted with innumerable small hills and valleys. [🔗](https://www.morethantokyo.com/mount-bandai-1888-eruption/)

As water accumulated in the low-lying depressions, hundreds of lakes and marshes formed, including the remarkable Goshikinuma pond cluster. While traditionally called the "Five-Colored Ponds" (referring to the five main ponds: Bishamon, Aka, Ao, Benten, and Midoro), the area actually contains 20-30 distinct bodies of water, each with its own character and hue.

## The Science Behind the Colors

The distinctive colors of Goshikinuma's ponds result from a complex interplay of volcanic chemistry and natural phenomena. The 1888 eruption forced acidic substances into the groundwater that flows into the ponds. These acids chemically transformed into aluminum silicate crystals which mixed into the water. The crystals reflect specific wavelengths of light, creating the mysterious and varied colors that give the ponds their fame. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/fukushima/goshikinuma/2551)

The vivid, multicolored shades are caused by chemicals and mineral particles such as aluminum silicate in the water and sand, with concentrations varying between ponds. [🔗](https://www.vikipandit.com/urabandai-goshikinuma-trail/) The colors range from cobalt blue, emerald green, and turquoise blue to pastel blue, with occasional hints of crimson. These hues vary based on seasonal changes, weather conditions, viewing angles, and the concentration of volcanic substances in the water. [🔗](https://www.jeepe.jp/articles/fukushima-goshikinuma-lakes-travel-guide-1096)

Some ponds maintain very acidic conditions with pH levels so low they cannot support aquatic life, a testament to the ongoing volcanic influence in the region. [🔗](https://unseen-japan.com/mount-bandai-japan-eruption-volcano/)

## The Individual Ponds

**Bishamon-numa (毘沙門沼)** - The largest pond in the system, known for its vivid emerald green color. Rowboats are available for hire on Bishamon-numa, allowing visitors to experience the pond from water level. Large numbers of carp can be seen swimming about, including a rare one with heart-shaped spots on her side which locals believe brings good luck to those who spot it. [🔗](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/goshikinuma-fukushima-s-otherworldy-beautiful-rainbow-lakes/) [🔗](https://fukushima.travel/destination/goshiki-numa-ponds/13)

**Ao-numa (青沼, Blue Pond)** - Displays a beautiful blue-green color with a somewhat milky aspect. The water's high acidity causes overhanging branches that touch the surface to bleach white, creating an otherworldly appearance. During autumn, the pond beautifully shimmers against the deep orange background of fall foliage. [🔗](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/goshikinuma-fukushima-s-otherworldy-beautiful-rainbow-lakes/)

**Aka-numa (赤沼, Red Pond)**, **Benten-numa (弁天沼)**, and **Midoro-numa (みどろ沼)** - Each displays its own distinctive coloration ranging from reddish green to various shades of blue and turquoise, contributing to the "five colors" that give the area its name. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshiki-numa)

The colors of each pond mysteriously fluctuate throughout the year with weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal changes, meaning no two visits reveal exactly the same palette. [🔗](https://fukushima.travel/destination/goshiki-numa-ponds/13)

## The Trail Experience

The Goshikinuma Nature Trail spans 3.6-4 km and leads mostly through forest, passing numerous ponds colored in various hues of blue, green, and turquoise. The path is relatively flat with minimal elevation gain (126m/413ft total), making it accessible to most fitness levels. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/five-coloured-lakes-japan-goshikinuma/)

**Trail Characteristics:**
- Distance: 3.6-4 km one-way
- Surface: Well-maintained, mostly flat forest trail
- Difficulty: Moderate (easy walking but attention needed for rocky sections and potential mud)
- Accessibility: Wheelchair friendly with maximum gradient of 5%, planked in places [🔗](https://www.tohokuandtokyo.org/spot_106/)
- Trail starts and ends at different locations (one-way route)
- Typical duration: 1-1.5 hours (steady walking pace) or 2-3 hours with photography stops [🔗](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/fukushima--2/goshikinuma-nature-trail)

The trail can be walked in either direction, but many visitors start at the eastern entrance (Goshikinuma Iriguchi) near the Urabandai Visitor Center and walk west to the Urabandai Bussan-kan, as this follows the natural flow of the pond sequence. After hiking the one-way trail, you can take a local bus between the two trailheads for 250 yen rather than backtracking.

## Seasonal Viewing Experience

**Autumn (Mid-October to Early November - OPTIMAL FOR VISIT):**
The contrast between the naturally colored ponds and the vibrant autumn foliage creates Goshikinuma's most spectacular visual experience. Maple, larch, and rowan trees display deep orange, red, and yellow hues that reflect on the pond surfaces, creating a "fantastical landscape" that draws photographers from across Japan. The pond colors appear most vivid against the warm-toned autumn backdrop.

**Other Seasons:**
- Spring: Fresh green foliage and wildflowers along the trail
- Summer: Lush forest canopy provides shade, comfortable mountain temperatures
- Winter: Snow transforms the landscape into a winter wonderland, with pond colors appearing especially vivid against white snow (snowshoes required for access) [🔗](https://www.urabandai-inf.com/en/?page_id=28080)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### Photography Strategies

**Best Photo Spots:**
- Bishamon-numa viewing platform: Captures the largest pond with mountain backdrop
- Ao-numa shoreline: The milky blue-green color photographs exceptionally well
- Various designated viewpoints along the trail offer pond-specific perspectives
- Use a polarizing filter to reduce glare and enhance water colors
- Bring a tripod for reflection photography in calm conditions [🔗](https://martinbaileyphotography.com/2015/06/01/the-five-color-lakes-goshikinuma-travelogue-podcast-474/)

**Best Timing:**
- Morning light (before 11:00 AM) offers best reflection visibility
- Overcast days can enhance water colors by reducing glare
- Calm weather essential for reflection photography
- Ponds face different directions, so lighting varies throughout the day [🔗](https://martinbaileyphotography.com/2015/06/01/the-five-color-lakes-goshikinuma-travelogue-podcast-474/)

### Crowd Avoidance

- Start early (7:00-8:00 AM) to beat tour groups and day-trippers
- Weekdays significantly less crowded than weekends during autumn season
- If visiting on weekend, arrive by 8:00 AM
- Western ponds (near Urabandai Bussan-kan) tend to be less crowded than eastern entrance ponds [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1120994-d1222009-Reviews-Goshikinuma_Lake-Kitashiobara_mura_Yama_gun_Fukushima_Prefecture_Tohoku.html)
