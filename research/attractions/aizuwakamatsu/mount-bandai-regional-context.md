Mount Bandai (磐梯山, Bandai-san) stands 1,816 meters high in Fukushima Prefecture, serving as the geographic and cultural heart of Bandai-Asahi National Park. This stratovolcano presents two dramatically different faces: from the south (Omote-bandai), it displays a beautiful conical shape known as "Aizu Fuji," while from the north (Urabandai), it reveals a wild, shattered profile—the dramatic scar of its catastrophic 1888 collapse.

## The 1888 Eruption and Its Legacy

On July 15, 1888, Mount Bandai erupted in one of Japan's most devastating volcanic events. At 7:45 AM, after violent earthquakes shook the ground, the Ko-Bandai peak collapsed in a massive phreatic explosion—a volcanic eruption caused by groundwater interacting with hot volcanic rocks rather than molten magma. This collapse unleashed a debris avalanche towering 75 meters high that surged northward at 80 kilometers per hour, spreading across 34 square kilometers and extending 15 kilometers from Mount Bandai.

The avalanche obliterated three entire hamlets, killing 477 people—the highest volcanic disaster casualty count in modern Japanese history. The massive debris flow dammed several rivers, creating Lakes Hibara, Onogawa, Akimoto, and the iconic Goshikinuma (Five-Colored Ponds) crater lakes. What had been orderly farmland transformed overnight into a boulder-strewn wasteland that would, over time, evolve into one of Tohoku's most scenic highland areas.

### Volcanic Significance

This eruption became a watershed moment for modern Japan. Japanese geologists Seikei Sekiya and Y. Kikuchi visited Bandai within days and published a report considered a classic in volcanology, establishing the "Bandaian-type eruption" classification for large phreatic explosions with voluminous debris avalanches. [🔗](https://unseen-japan.com/mount-bandai-japan-eruption-volcano/)

The Meiji government's swift disaster response—including Emperor Meiji's personal donation of 3,000 yen and deployment of the Japanese Red Cross Society in its first peacetime relief mission—signaled Aizu region's full integration into the modernizing nation and established protocols that would shape Japanese disaster management for generations.

In recognition of this geological and cultural significance, the area surrounding Mount Bandai was designated as a Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Committee in 2011. The Bandai-san Geopark showcases how volcanic activity created beautiful scenery through repeated rock avalanches, transforming catastrophe into one of Japan's most distinctive landscapes.
