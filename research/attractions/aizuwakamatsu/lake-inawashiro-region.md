The Lake Inawashiro Region encompasses Japan's fourth-largest lake, the dramatic Mount Bandai volcano, and the Urabandai lake district - a stunning landscape born from the catastrophic 1888 eruption. Located approximately 30 minutes from Aizuwakamatsu via the JR Ban'etsu West Line, this area offers a unique combination of natural beauty, volcanic history, cultural significance, and world-class art collections. The region is known as "Tenkyo-ko" (天鏡湖), meaning "Heavenly Mirror Lake," for its crystal-clear waters that reflect Mount Bandai and the sky. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1743/)

**GPS Coordinates:** 37.476374°N, 140.093282°E (Lake Inawashiro central area)

Lake Inawashiro sits at the heart of a dramatic volcanic landscape within Bandai-Asahi National Park. The lake itself covers 104 square kilometers with a circumference of 63 kilometers, reaching depths of 94 meters at an altitude of 514 meters. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Inawashiro) The waters are renowned for their exceptional clarity - so transparent that visitors can see the lakebed and watch the reflections of towering Mount Bandai (1,816m) known as "Aizu Fuji" for its resemblance to Mount Fuji.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**The 1888 Mount Bandai Eruption:**

The region's character was profoundly shaped by Mount Bandai's violent eruption on July 15, 1888. The explosion killed at least 477 people and dramatically altered the landscape - approximately 1.5 cubic kilometers of the mountain's summit collapsed and flowed northward, creating a rough crater wall and damming rivers. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1888_eruption_of_Mount_Bandai) This catastrophe inadvertently created the Urabandai (back-Bandai) lake district, including Lake Hibara and the famous Goshikinuma (Five-Colored Ponds), where mineral-rich waters gleam in intense hues of blue, green, and turquoise. [🔗](https://www.urabandai-inf.com/en/?page_id=29854)

The 1888 eruption remains culturally significant for the Aizu region. Emperor Meiji's decision to donate 3,000 yen for relief efforts was particularly notable, coming only two decades after Aizu fought against his government in the Boshin War. Of Hibara Village's original six hamlets, two were submerged beneath Lake Hibara, three were buried by debris, and only one survived - a poignant torii gate extending above the water surface serves as a memorial to the lost communities.

**Cultural Heritage Sites:**

The area seamlessly blends natural wonder with cultural significance. Hanitsu Shrine, a National Historic Site, commemorates Hoshina Masayuki (1611-1672), the first lord of the Aizu Domain and son of Tokugawa Hidetada. [🔗](https://fukushima.travel/destination/hanitsu-shrine/182) The shrine grounds, with their ancient stone monuments including the massive Kame-ishi, become especially striking during autumn foliage season when maple and ginkgo trees turn vibrant red and gold.

Remarkably, the region also houses the Morohashi Museum of Modern Art, which holds the third-largest Salvador Dalí collection in the world and the only permanent Dalí exhibition in Asia, with over 340 pieces. [🔗](https://dali.jp/en/about/)
