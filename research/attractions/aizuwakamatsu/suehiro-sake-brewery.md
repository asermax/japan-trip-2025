Suehiro Sake Brewery stands as one of Fukushima Prefecture's most historically significant cultural attractions, founded in 1850 during the final years of the Edo Period. The brewery has been operated by seven to eight generations of the Suehiro family and holds the distinction of being the birthplace of the revolutionary yamahai brewing method that transformed sake production across Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7702.html)

The brewery's cultural importance extends beyond its innovative brewing techniques. In collaboration with brewing engineer Kinichiro Kagi around 1910, the fourth president developed the yamahai brewing method, which eliminated the exhausting pole-ramming (yama-oroshi) process used in traditional kimoto brewing. This innovation marked "the end of stirring work" and represented a revolution for brewers throughout Japan while maintaining the traditional use of naturally occurring lactic bacteria for fermentation.

The Kaeigura, the historic building where sake is still brewed using traditional methods, has been designated as an important historical building by Aizu-Wakamatsu City and is registered as a Tangible Cultural Property. Built between the Meiji (1868-1912) and Taisho (1912-1926) eras, the imposing hall features a high atrium rarely seen in old Japanese architecture.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Today, Suehiro's prizewinning sake is exported worldwide and serves as the official sake supplier to the revered Toshogu Shrine in Nikko. The brewery has won numerous national and international awards, contributing to Fukushima Prefecture's remarkable achievement of winning more gold medals than any other prefecture at the Annual Japan Sake Awards eight consecutive times.

The brewery also maintains a connection to Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, the renowned bacteriologist featured on Japan's 1,000 yen bill, with his letters and photographs on display for visitors. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7702.html)

Fukushima sake tends to be light and intricate with mellow aroma and natural umami from rice. Blessed with high-quality rice and pure water from Mount Bandai, the Aizu region is one of Japan's premier sake-producing areas.
