Oyaku-en (御薬園), which translates to "Medicinal Herb Garden," is a traditional Japanese landscape garden in Aizuwakamatsu designated as a Place of Scenic Beauty by the Japanese government in 1932. The garden centers around a distinctive heart-shaped pond (Shinji no Ike, shaped like the kanji character for "heart" 心) and features approximately 400 varieties of medicinal herbs and trees cultivated for traditional remedies.

Oyakuen Garden represents a unique intersection of samurai culture, traditional medicine, and Japanese landscape design. First established in the 1380s, the garden was maintained as a sacred villa by Ashina Morihisa, the 10th feudal lord of the Ashina clan, in the 1430s. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyaku-en) The garden's transformation into a medicinal herb cultivation center occurred in 1670 when Hoshina Masatsune, the second daimyō of the Aizu Domain, began cultivating various herbs, notably Korean ginseng, establishing the garden's identity as reflected in its name given in the 18th century. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7706.html)

The current landscape design, created by Edo period-trained landscape architect Meguro Jotei, exemplifies traditional Japanese garden principles by showing "nature in miniature." The garden features the distinctive heart-shaped pond with carefully cultivated greenery, winding paths, small stone bridges, and miniaturized waterfalls. The Ochayagoten tea house, dating from the Muromachi period, served as the venue where feudal lords entertained visiting nobles.

Today, the garden maintains approximately 400 kinds of medicinal herbs and trees passed down through generations, continuing the Aizu Domain's tradition of medicinal plant knowledge. The garden showcases seasonal beauty year-round, with tree peonies in spring, lotuses in summer, Japanese anemones and spectacular autumn foliage from maple trees in fall, and snow-covered landscapes in winter.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

**Samurai Medicine and Domain Healthcare:**
The garden's transformation in 1670 under Hoshina Masatsune reflects the Aizu Domain's sophisticated approach to public health and welfare. The daimyō's initiative to cultivate medicinal plants—particularly Korean ginseng, a rare and valuable herb—demonstrated the domain's commitment to protecting citizens from epidemics and illness. [🔗](http://samurai-city.jp/en/sightseeing/1053) This was expanded to encourage private citizens to grow medicinal plants, establishing a domain-wide pharmaceutical system that was remarkably progressive for its time. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7706.html)

**Traditional Japanese Garden Philosophy:**
Designed by Meguro Jotei, the garden exemplifies the principle of "shukei" (縮景)—showing nature in miniature. Every element, from the placement of rocks to the pruning of trees, is carefully orchestrated to create idealized natural landscapes at a reduced scale. The heart-shaped pond, winding paths, stone bridges, and miniaturized waterfalls work together to evoke mountains, valleys, and rivers within a compact space. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyaku-en)

**Feudal Lord's Entertainment Venue:**
The Ochayagoten tea house, dating from the Muromachi period (1336-1573), served as the exclusive venue for the feudal lord and his noble guests. This historic structure embodies the refined cultural sophistication of the samurai class, where political discussions were conducted amid tea ceremony rituals and aesthetic contemplation. [🔗](https://www.tohokukanko.jp/en/attractions/detail_1294.html)

**Living Pharmaceutical Heritage:**
The 400 varieties of medicinal herbs maintained here represent over 350 years of continuous botanical knowledge transmission. The garden serves as a living archive of traditional Japanese medicine (*kampo*), preserving plant varieties and cultivation techniques that have been passed down through generations since the Edo period. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7706.html)

**Government Recognition:**
The garden's designation as a Place of Scenic Beauty in 1932 by the Japanese government acknowledges its exceptional historical and cultural value, placing it among Japan's most important traditional landscapes worthy of preservation. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyaku-en)
