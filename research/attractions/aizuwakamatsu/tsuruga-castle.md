Tsuruga Castle (é¶´ãƒ¶åŸŽ, Tsurugajo), also known as Aizuwakamatsu Castle, stands as one of Japan's most historically significant fortresses, representing the final chapter of the samurai era. Located in the center of the Aizu basin in Fukushima Prefecture, this castle is uniquely distinguished as **the only castle in Japan with a red-tiled roof**, restored to its historical appearance during the 2011 renovation. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7703.html)

The castle's most critical role in Japanese history occurred during the Boshin War (1868-1869), when the Aizu clan, fiercely loyal to the Tokugawa Shogunate, made their last stand against imperial forces. In October 1868, the castle endured a brutal month-long siege as modern Western artillery pounded its walls. On October 29, the attack intensified with 50 cannons each firing 50 shells into the castle's interior. Survivors described the assault as "extremely terrifying, surrounded by cannon fire from every direction, and the bullets from enemy rifles fell like rain."

Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, the Aizu samurai mounted a formidable defense, showcasing legendary discipline and martial prowess. Inside the castle walls, 5,000 citizens sheltered alongside military forces, including 600 women and children who formed organized workgroups to cook, clean, make gun cartridges, and nurse nearly 1,500 wounded soldiers. Around 20-30 women formed the Joshigun, their own defensive unit to actively defend the castle. [ðŸ”—](https://www.ndl.go.jp/scenery/e/column/tohoku/the_aizu_war.html)

The most famous female warrior was Nakano Takeko (1847-1868), a skilled naginata fighter who led an unofficial women's unit called the Joshitai. When mortally wounded during battle, she asked her sister Yuko to behead her to prevent the enemy from taking her head as a trophy, ensuring she received an honorable burial. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakano_Takeko) [ðŸ”—](https://samurai-city.jp/en/history/2210)

The eventual surrender on November 6, 1868, broke the final major resistance to the new Meiji government, effectively marking the end of Japan's feudal era. [ðŸ”—](https://fukushima.travel/blogs/tsurugajo-castle-the-meiji-restoration/44)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### The Red Tile Roof Restoration

The castle's distinctive red roof tiles carry profound historical significance. The original castle keep was dismantled in 1874 by the Meiji government as a symbolic act to erase icons of the old feudal order. A concrete reconstruction was built in 1965 with standard grey tiles, but historical research revealed that during the late Edo periodâ€”particularly during the Boshin Warâ€”the castle had distinctive red roof tiles. [ðŸ”—](https://visitjapan-vegetarian.com/tsuruga-castle-the-only-red-roofed-castle-in-japan/)

The 2011 restoration project replaced the grey tiles with historically accurate red ones, returning the castle to its exact appearance during its most defiant moment in history. The red color comes from iron-containing glaze, and these tiles excel in insulationâ€”crucial for enduring Aizu's harsh winters. This restoration was not merely aesthetic but a powerful statement of regional identity and cultural pride. [ðŸ”—](https://fukushima.travel/destination/tsurugajo-castle/9)

### The Byakkotai Tragedy Connection

The siege is inseparable from the tragic story of the Byakkotai (White Tiger Force), a reserve unit of teenage samurai aged 16-17 who were mobilized to defend the domain. During a retreat, a group of these young warriors from their position on nearby Iimoriyama saw smoke rising from the castle town and mistakenly believed the castle had fallen. Rather than face the dishonor of capture, they committed ritual suicide (seppuku). This act of ultimate loyalty has become a powerful symbol of the Aizu spirit, and their graves on Iimoriyama remain an important pilgrimage site.

### Architectural and Defensive Features

Tsuruga Castle was designed as a formidable fortress with multiple defensive layers. The central keep was protected by deep moats and high, intricate stone wallsâ€”considered some of the best in northern Japan. The nearby Yukawa River was integrated as a natural moat protecting the southern face. The castle featured multiple baileys or enclosures (Honmaru, Ninomaru) creating layered defenses that forced invading armies to fight through successive fortified areas.

## Integration with Other Locations

Tsuruga Castle serves as the historical and cultural centerpiece of Aizuwakamatsu, providing essential context for understanding the entire Aizu region's identity. The castle's story directly connects to:

- **Mt. Iimoriyama**: Where the Byakkotai witnessed the castle under siege before their tragic suicide (50-minute walk or 35-minute bus ride for Â¥210)
- **Aizu Bukeyashiki**: Samurai residences that housed the warriors who defended the castle
- **Suehiro Sake Brewery**: Founded 1850, short distance from castle, represents the domain's prosperity
- **Ouchi-juku**: Historic post town (30 km away) that served travelers to and from the Aizu domain [ðŸ”—](https://donnykimball.com/aizu-wakamatsu-8ff90f764e75)

### Recommended Combination Visit

Tsuruga Castle and Mt. Iimoriyama make an ideal combination visit, telling both sides of the Byakkotai story. The walking route (50 minutes) passes through Aizu-Wakamatsu's backstreets with Hokkeji Buddhist temple and Akanumainari Shinto Shrine. Alternatively, the Machinaka Shuyu Bus connects both sites (35 minutes, Â¥210). [ðŸ”—](https://www.tohokukanko.jp/en/attractions/detail_1683.html)

## Important Notes

**Physical Requirements:**
- Castle tower requires climbing five floors of stairs with no elevator access
- Not suitable for visitors with significant mobility limitations
- Observation deck stairs may be steep and narrow
- Allow 1-2 hours minimum for tower visit depending on fitness level [ðŸ”—](https://teachtranslatetravelrepeat.com/tsuruga-castle/)

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
Remember that this site represents one of Japan's most tragic historical moments. The Boshin War resulted in significant loss of life, particularly among young samurai. Approach exhibits about the Byakkotai and war casualties with appropriate solemnity and respect for the regional memory of these events.

**Transportation from Tokyo:**
Aizuwakamatsu is accessible from Tokyo via JR Tohoku Shinkansen to Koriyama, then JR Ban'etsu West Line to Aizu-Wakamatsu Station (total journey approximately 3 hours). Plan accordingly for day trip timing or consider overnight stay in the region. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7701.html)
