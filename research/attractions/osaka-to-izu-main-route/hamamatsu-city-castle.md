Hamamatsu Castle stands as one of Japan's most historically significant fortifications, earning the nickname "Shusse-jo" (Castle of Success) due to its association with Tokugawa Ieyasu and the remarkable career advancement of its subsequent lords. Located in central Hamamatsu city - Japan's UNESCO-designated "City of Music" - the castle offers a compelling detour for travelers on the Tomei Expressway, combining feudal history with modern cultural attractions. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamamatsu_Castle)

Originally built as Hikuma Castle, Ieyasu relocated his base from Okazaki Castle in 1570 at age 29, expanded the fortifications, and renamed it Hamamatsu Castle in 1577. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamamatsu_Castle) During his 17 years at Hamamatsu (1570-1586), Ieyasu fought crucial battles including the Battle of Anegawa and the Battle of Nagashino that shaped the Sengoku period. Most notably, he suffered his defining defeat at the 1572 Battle of Mikatagahara against the legendary Takeda Shingen, a harrowing experience that taught him invaluable lessons in military tactics and perseverance. [ðŸ”—](https://www.kanpai-japan.com/hamamatsu/castle) These formative years laid the groundwork for his eventual unification of Japan after the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. [ðŸ”—](https://amazing-garden.jp/post-2371/)

The castle's nickname "Shusse-jo" (Castle of Success) stems not only from Ieyasu's rise to power but from a remarkable tradition: of the 25 daimyo who ruled Hamamatsu under the Edo shogunate, most were promoted to higher-ranking domains or prestigious positions as Roju (senior councilors). [ðŸ”—](https://www.mlit.go.jp/river/toukei_chousa/kasen/jiten/nihon_kawa/85051/85051-2.html) This consistent pattern of advancement cemented the castle's reputation as a place of good fortune and a stepping stone to greater office.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Tokugawa Ieyasu's Formative Years

Hamamatsu Castle occupies a pivotal position in Japanese history as the headquarters where Tokugawa Ieyasu transformed from a regional warlord into the architect of 250 years of peace. The castle's strategic location midway between Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo) on the historic Tokaido road made it crucial for controlling trade and military movements during the Warring States period.

During his residence at Hamamatsu, Ieyasu experienced both triumph and devastating defeat. The 1572 Battle of Mikatagahara, where Takeda Shingen's forces routed Ieyasu's army, became a defining moment. According to legend, Ieyasu was so terrified he soiled himself during the retreat. Rather than hiding this humiliation, he commissioned a portrait of himself in this moment of defeat as a constant reminder to remain humble and learn from failure. This formative experience shaped his later military and political strategy. [ðŸ”—](https://www.kanpai-japan.com/hamamatsu/castle)

The current white-and-black three-story keep was reconstructed in 1958 using reinforced concrete, while the authentic Tenshu Gate was restored in 2014. [ðŸ”—](https://www.inhamamatsu.com/culture/hamamatsu-castle.php) The castle's greatest treasure remains its original 400-year-old stone base, constructed using the mortarless Nozura-zumi technique that has withstood centuries of earthquakes.

### UNESCO City of Music Heritage

Hamamatsu's identity as the "City of Music" began in 1887 when Torakusu Yamaha successfully repaired a reed organ, leading him to found Nippon Gakki Co., Ltd. (now Yamaha Corporation). The company produced Japan's first domestically made piano in 1900. [ðŸ”—](https://go-centraljapan.jp/story/en/15/) When Koichi Kawai, who had apprenticed under Yamaha, founded Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing Co. in 1927, Hamamatsu's position as Japan's instrument-making capital was secured. [ðŸ”—](https://www.roland.com/global/company/hamamatsu/)

The city officially launched its "City of Music" initiative in 1981, culminating in the creation of the Hamamatsu Museum of Musical Instruments and the prestigious Hamamatsu International Piano Competition. [ðŸ”—](https://www.city.hamamatsu.shizuoka.jp/huck/en/music.html) In 2014, UNESCO designated Hamamatsu a Creative City of Music - the first city in Asia to receive this honor. [ðŸ”—](https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/hamamatsu)

The city's success stems from a combination of access to high-quality Tenryu forest timber and the local "Yaramaika" spirit - a dialect phrase meaning "Let's give it a try!" that reflects the region's culture of ambitious entrepreneurship and innovation. [ðŸ”—](https://www.blackbox.jp/journal/hamamatsu-the-city-of-music-and-manufacturing/) Today, global giants Yamaha, Kawai, and Roland continue to operate in Hamamatsu, combining generations of artisanal knowledge with cutting-edge technology.
