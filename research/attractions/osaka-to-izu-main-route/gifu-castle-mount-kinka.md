Gifu Castle stands as one of Japan's most dramatically positioned fortresses, crowning the 329-meter summit of Mount Kinka in the heart of Gifu City. This mountaintop stronghold was the seat of power for Oda Nobunaga, one of the "three great unifiers" of Japan, from 1567 to 1576. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1270/)

The castle's strategic importance during the Sengoku (Warring States) period cannot be overstated. Perched atop Mount Kinka in Mino Province, it controlled critical transportation routes including the historic Nakasendo, serving as the gateway to Kyoto. A popular saying of the era proclaimed, "he who controls Mino controls the country." After conquering the castle in 1567, Nobunaga renamed it Gifu and made it his primary base, revealing his ambition to unify Japan with his personal seal "Tenka Fubu" (å¤©ä¸‹å¸ƒæ­¦) - "unify the realm with military might."

The current three-story keep is a 1956 concrete reconstruction based on original drawings, though with some modifications. The original castle was destroyed in 1600 during the lead-up to the pivotal Battle of Sekigahara when Japan was finally unified. However, visitors can still see authentic moss-covered stone walls from the Warring States period, offering a tangible connection to the samurai era. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1270/)

Inside the reconstructed keep, three floors of museum exhibits chronicle Gifu Castle's history: the first floor focuses on "Nobunaga's Castle Town Development," the second on "Nobunaga's Castle Construction," and the third on "The World Seen by Nobunaga." The museum displays an impressive collection of Edo Period armor, samurai weapons, traditional swords, historical photographs, maps, and artifacts that recreate the story of the castle and its legendary lord. Explanations are provided in both English and Japanese. [ðŸ”—](https://visitgifu.com/see-do/gifu-castle/)

At the base of Mount Kinka lies Gifu Park, the former site of Nobunaga's residential palace and gardens. Excavations have unearthed gold-leafed tiles hinting at the opulence of his court. The park now houses several cultural institutions including the Gifu City Museum of History (opened 1985, renovated 2005), which features recreations of Nobunaga's Warring States Period free market and exhibits on regional traditional crafts; and the Nawa Insect Museum, Japan's first insect museum (founded 1919), containing over 300,000 specimens from 12,000 species.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Gifu Castle represents a powerful thematic connection to Japan's unification story as you travel from Osaka (seat of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's power) toward the Izu Peninsula. This mountaintop fortress was where Oda Nobunaga first proclaimed his ambition to "unify the realm with military might" - a pivotal moment in Japanese history that would ultimately lead to the end of the Warring States period.

The castle's commanding position atop Mount Kinka visually demonstrates the strategic thinking of Sengoku-era warlords. From this natural fortress, Nobunaga controlled the gateway to Kyoto and major transportation routes, illustrating how geography shaped military strategy and political power. This tangible connection to history enriches understanding of the regions you'll travel through.

The original 400-year-old moss-covered stone walls using the mortarless Nozura-zumi technique showcase the remarkable engineering of the period, having withstood centuries of earthquakes. These authentic remains provide visitors with a direct physical connection to the Warring States era, even though the keep itself is a modern reconstruction.
