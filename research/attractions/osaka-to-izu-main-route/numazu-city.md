Numazu is a historic port city in Shizuoka Prefecture, positioned between Mount Fuji to the north and Suruga Bay (Japan's deepest bay at 2,500 meters) to the south. Located 130 kilometers west of Tokyo, the city serves as the geographical and cultural gateway to the Izu Peninsula, offering a unique blend of maritime heritage, scenic Mount Fuji views, and exceptional seafood culture. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numazu) [ðŸ”—](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/inspirations/stories/spotlight/numazu-spotlight/)

Numazu's identity is deeply rooted in its relationship with Suruga Bay and Mount Fuji. The bay's extreme depth creates a nutrient-rich environment supporting about 40% of Japan's native fish species, making Numazu Port a vital commercial fishing hub and the source of the region's distinctive "deep-sea dining" culture. The city is particularly famous for its horse mackerel (aji), accounting for half of Japan's production. [ðŸ”—](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/inspirations/stories/spotlight/numazu-spotlight/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Historically, Numazu holds significance as the location of Hara-juku, the 13th of the 53 stations along the ancient Tokaido highway connecting Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto. The iconic view of Mount Fuji from this former post town, often framed by pine trees, was immortalized by ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige. The Imperial Family favored Numazu as a retreat, establishing a villa there in 1893, which is now a public memorial park. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numazu)

The combination of Numazu's coastal landscape with Mount Fuji creates culturally iconic views that have inspired Japanese art for centuries. The reflection of Fuji in the Kano River, known as "upside-down Fuji," and the views from Senbon Matsubara (Thousand Pine Grove) represent classic motifs in Japanese spirituality and art, symbolizing the harmony of powerful natural forces.
