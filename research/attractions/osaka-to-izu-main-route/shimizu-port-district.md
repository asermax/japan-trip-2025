Shimizu Port District combines maritime heritage, historic Tokaido post station significance, and stunning Mount Fuji waterfront views. As one of Japan's three most beautiful ports, it offers fresh seafood markets, cultural attractions, and unique perspectives on Mount Fuji that differ from purely scenic viewpoints. The district provides an authentic Tokaido travel experience, connecting modern highway journeys to 400 years of Japanese maritime and pilgrimage traditions.

## Historical & Cultural Significance

### Tokaido Road Heritage

Shimizu Port District occupies the site of **Ejiri-juku**, the 18th of the 53 post stations along the historic Tokaido Road connecting Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo). [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejiri-juku) At its peak during the Edo period, Ejiri-juku had two honjin (elite inns), three sub-honjin, and 50 hatago (standard inns) among 1,340 total buildings serving a population of around 6,500. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejiri-juku)

The area achieved artistic immortality through **Katsushika Hokusai's famous ukiyo-e print "Ejiri in Suruga Province"** (c. 1830-32), the 35th print in his celebrated "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji" series. [🔗](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/55735) This dramatic woodblock print depicts travelers battling fierce winds along the Tokaido highway with Mount Fuji as a silent backdrop, capturing something invisible—the wind itself—with papers and hats flying through the air. [🔗](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/55735)

Utagawa Hiroshige also featured Ejiri-juku in his "Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido" series (1833-34), further cementing the area's place in Japanese artistic heritage. [🔗](https://www.artelino.com/articles/hiroshige-hoeido-tokaido.asp)

### Maritime Trade History

In July 1899, an Imperial decree established Shimizu as an open port for international trade with the United States and the United Kingdom following the Meiji Restoration. [🔗](https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/overview-1/history/) The port quickly became Japan's dominant tea export hub: by 1910, Shimizu was shipping more green tea than Yokohama, and by 1918, it was exporting 80% of all Japanese green tea. [🔗](https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/overview-1/history/)

This flourishing trade with Shimizu Port as its base led Japan's post-WWII economic recovery and helped invigorate domestic trade as a whole. [🔗](https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/overview-1/history/) The port expanded beyond tea to handle citrus fruits, canned goods, motorcycles, and musical instruments as coastal areas industrialized. [🔗](https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/overview-1/history/)

Today, Shimizu Port is recognized as one of Japan's three most beautiful ports, with a maritime history traceable to the 7th century. [🔗](https://exploreshizuoka.jp/en/inspirations/stories/spotlight/spotlight-shizuoka-port-towns-2/)

### UNESCO World Heritage Connection

The nearby **Miho no Matsubara** pine grove (7 km coastal stretch on the Miho Peninsula) was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 2013 as part of "Mt. Fuji: Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration." [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miho_no_Matsubara) The scenic combination of ancient pine trees, coastline, and Mount Fuji views has inspired Japanese artists for centuries, appearing in woodblock prints by both Hokusai and Hiroshige.

### Seasonal Seafood Specialties

**Sakura Ebi (Cherry Shrimp) - Peak November Season**

November 5th marks the opening of the autumn sakura ebi fishing season at Yui Port and Oigawa Port in Shimizu Ward, running through December 24. [🔗](https://shizuokagourmet.com/sakura-ebi sakura-shrimp/) These translucent pink shrimp, named after cherry blossoms, are caught exclusively in Suruga Bay—Shizuoka Prefecture is the only place in Japan with a fishing license for them. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_shrimp)

The small shrimp (about 40mm long) are highly prized for their sweet flavor and are fished only during two brief seasons: April-May and November-December. [🔗](https://shizuokagourmet.com/sakura-ebi sakura-shrimp/) Popular preparations include:
- Raw sakura ebi rice bowls (fresh and sweet)
- Kakiage tempura (crispy fried fritters)

**Maguro (Tuna) - Year-Round Specialty**

Shimizu Port boasts the largest catch of frozen tuna in Japan. [🔗](https://www.shizuoka-tour.com/the-tourists-attractions/shimizu-fish-market-kashinoichi/) Fresh tuna and other Suruga Bay seafood remain excellent throughout November, making this an ideal time for fresh seafood dining at Kashi no Ichi fish market.

[🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298124-d1425290-Reviews-Shimizu_Port-Shizuoka_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

**Mount Fuji Viewing:** Visibility can vary throughout the day—morning views are most reliable, with cloud cover increasing by afternoon. November's 60-70% visibility rate makes it worthwhile to allow time for photography. [🔗](https://www.alwayspacktissues.com/post/shimizu-port)

**Dining Timing:** Kashi no Ichi gets crowded from 11:00 AM onward. Arriving at opening (9:30 AM) or slightly before lunch rush provides the best experience. [🔗](https://www.shizuoka-tour.com/the-tourists-attractions/shimizu-fish-market-kashinoichi/)

**Local Hospitality:** Visitors describe residents as "friendly and helpful," contributing to a welcoming atmosphere despite potential language barriers. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298124-d1425290-Reviews-Shimizu_Port-Shizuoka_Shizuoka_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html)

## Route Integration

### Tokaido Highway Connection

Shimizu Port occupies the historic Ejiri-juku post station site along the original Tokaido corridor—the same 515 km Edo-period highway your route follows via the modern Tomei Expressway. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejiri-juku) This stop offers a tangible connection to the highway's 400-year history, complementing the route's overall Tokaido heritage theme.

The area's artistic legacy through Hokusai's and Hiroshige's ukiyo-e prints provides cultural depth to what might otherwise be a simple rest stop, transforming it into a living museum of Tokaido travel traditions. [🔗](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/55735)

### Maritime & Tea Trade Heritage

As you travel from Osaka through Shizuoka toward the Izu Peninsula, Shimizu Port represents the region's transformation from Edo-period post station to modern international trade hub. The port's role in exporting 80% of Japan's green tea by 1918 directly connects to Shizuoka's identity as the nation's largest tea producer (40% of Japan's tea production). [🔗](https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/overview-1/history/)

This maritime trade history complements your route's exploration of Shizuoka's tea culture, providing the "export side" of the region's agricultural heritage.

### Mount Fuji Viewing Progression

**Strategic Positioning:** Shimizu Port offers waterfront Mount Fuji views that differ from later Izu Peninsula perspectives:
- **Shimizu:** Northern Suruga Bay perspective with port/industrial foreground
- **Later Izu:** Southern/coastal perspectives with natural landscapes

This stop provides a unique "city meets mountain" viewpoint that showcases Mount Fuji's cultural integration into urban Japanese life, distinct from purely scenic natural viewing points along your route.

### Alternative Options

**If Shimizu Port Is Unavailable:**

**Weather/Visibility Issues:**
- Mount Fuji views not guaranteed (60-70% November probability)
- Waterfront experience remains valuable even without mountain visibility
- Fish market and cultural sites operate regardless of weather

**Time Constraints:**
- Skip if running behind schedule—continue to NEOPASA Shimizu Service Area for quick Shizuoka seafood experience
- Prioritize Miho no Matsubara if interested primarily in UNESCO heritage/coastal views

**Wednesday Closures:**
- Kashi no Ichi fish market closed Wednesdays
- S-Pulse Dream Plaza remains open with dining alternatives
- Consider alternative day or skip this stop entirely if fish market is primary draw
