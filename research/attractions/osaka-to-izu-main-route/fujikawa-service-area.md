Fujikawa Service Area stands as a landmark along Japan's Tomei Expressway, embodying the sophisticated evolution of Japanese highway service areas from basic rest stops to comprehensive destination facilities. Since the Tomei Expressway opened in 1969 connecting Tokyo and Nagoya, service areas have transformed into cultural destinations showcasing local products, regional cuisine, and entertainment options.

The facility occupies a historically and geographically significant location along the Fujikawa River, one of Japan's three fastest-flowing rivers, in an area that once served as Fujikawa post town (Fujikawa-juku) on the historic Tokaido Road. This coastal route has been Japan's most important transportation corridor for centuries, connecting the political center of Edo (Tokyo) with the cultural heartland of Kyoto and Osaka. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dmei_Expressway)

The facility operates as a dual-access complex, serving both expressway travelers through EXPASA Fujikawa (inbound toward Tokyo and outbound toward Nagoya) and general visitors through the adjacent Fujikawa Rakuza roadside station accessible via local roads.

### The Ferris Wheel Experience

The signature attraction, Fuji Sky View, opened in February 2017 as a 60-meter-tall Ferris wheel offering unparalleled views of Mount Fuji, Fuji City, Suruga Bay, and the swift-flowing Fujikawa River below. The 12-minute ride features 36 gondolas, including eight with transparent glass floors for enhanced viewing and one specially equipped pet-friendly gondola with cushioned flooring and pet beds. At sunset, the Ferris wheel transforms into an illuminated landmark with changing light displays every 15 minutes. [ðŸ”—](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/6058/)

### Roadside Station Fujikawa Rakuza

The four-story Fujikawa Rakuza building serves as the cultural and educational heart of the complex. Beyond typical service area amenities, it houses the MEGASTAR-IIA planetarium with a 14-meter tilted dome - a rare feature for a roadside facility. The planetarium previously held a Guinness World Record and was upgraded in July 2018. [ðŸ”—](https://www.megastar.jp/en/fujikawarakuza/)

The facility also contains the Yoji Totsuka Neutrino Museum, honoring the Fuji City physicist who discovered that neutrinos have mass. This free museum introduces visitors to cutting-edge physics through interactive panels and hands-on devices. [ðŸ”—](https://www.fujikawarakuza.co.jp/english/museum-neutrino.html)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Fujikawa Service Area represents the modern evolution of historic Tokaido post towns that served travelers for centuries. The facility showcases Shizuoka Prefecture specialties, Japan's leading tea producer (40% of national production) and a region renowned for exceptional seafood from Suruga Bay. The service area features multiple dining venues highlighting hyper-local specialties: shirasu (young sardines) from Tago no Ura arrive at the market within 15 minutes of being caught, while sakura ebi (cherry shrimp) can only be harvested at two locations in Japan - both in Shizuoka.

### Weather Preparation for November

- Afternoon warming to 20Â°C allows comfortable outdoor exploring
- Clear skies typical but bring umbrella as autumn can bring occasional rain
- Ferris wheel operates in light rain but may close during severe weather

## Important Notes

**Mount Fuji Visibility Dependency:** The primary attraction - Mount Fuji viewing - depends entirely on weather conditions. November offers favorable statistics (57% visibility) but clear views are never guaranteed. The service area offers substantial value even without Mount Fuji visibility through its planetarium, museum, dining, and Ferris wheel experience.

**ETC Smart Interchange:** Vehicles equipped with ETC systems can use the Smart Interchange for convenient highway entry and exit. Non-ETC vehicles can only access Fujikawa Rakuza via local roads. [ðŸ”—](https://globalsapa.c-nexco.co.jp/en/sapa/33/)

**Two Separate Facilities:** Understand the distinction between EXPASA Fujikawa (expressway service area) and Fujikawa Rakuza (roadside station accessible from local roads). Both share some facilities but have different access points.
