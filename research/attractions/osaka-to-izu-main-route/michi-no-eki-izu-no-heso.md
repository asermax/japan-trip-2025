Michi-no-Eki Izu no Heso (道の駅 伊豆のへそ, literally "Roadside Station - Navel of Izu") is a modern, multi-purpose roadside station located in the geographical center of the Izu Peninsula in Izunokuni City, Shizuoka Prefecture. The facility embodies the "Buy, Play, Eat, Stay" concept, offering a comprehensive rest stop experience that goes far beyond the typical roadside station. [🔗](https://www.izunoheso.com/)

The station achieved priority roadside station status on January 30, 2015, and underwent a major renovation reopening on November 23, 2018, centered around the Izu Ichigo (Strawberry) Factory. Its uniqueness lies in its thematic focus on **strawberries**, a signature product of Izunokuni City, which ranks 5th nationally in strawberry production value and 4th in cultivated area. The facility integrates comprehensive services including a local beer brewery, buffet restaurant, extensive gift shops, and hands-on experiences.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Michi-no-Eki Culture in Japan

Michi-no-Eki (道の駅, "roadside stations") represent a uniquely Japanese approach to highway rest stops, established by the government to serve three essential functions: providing rest and refreshment with free 24-hour parking and restroom facilities, serving as information hubs for local road and tourism information, and promoting community economic revitalization through regional product marketplaces. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/michi-no-eki/)

These stations are beloved by both locals and travelers as they offer direct connections to regional culture and products in a lively, market-like atmosphere. Unlike standard highway rest areas, michi-no-eki emphasize local character and community engagement.

### What Makes Izu no Heso Unique

While many michi-no-eki are modest, functional facilities, Izu no Heso stands out as a modern, large-scale "hybrid" destination that has evolved beyond the traditional model. The name "Izu no Heso" (Navel of Izu) reflects its central location on the Izu Peninsula, positioned along Route 414 near the Ohito Chuo Interchange on the Izu Chuo Highway.

The facility's thematic focus on strawberries connects directly to Izunokuni's agricultural heritage. Strawberry cultivation in the region dates back to the Showa era, with the birthplace being Tamagawa in nearby Mishima City, spreading to the Nirayama area. The station showcases regional varieties like **Benihoppe** and **Akihime**, known for their large size and perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.
