The Takayama to Kinosaki route (225-226 miles / 360-365 km) follows multiple expressway systems with strategically spaced service areas approximately every 50 kilometers.

### Service Areas as Cultural Experiences

Japanese expressway service areas represent a unique cultural phenomenon where regional identity, craft traditions, and culinary specialties converge for travelers. Unlike typical highway rest stops, Japanese SAs function as:

**Regional Showcases:** Each service area features products, crafts, and foods representing the specific region and prefecture, creating a progressive cultural experience as travelers move through different areas. [🔗](https://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00002/)

**Smart Interchange Opportunities:** Some service areas like Hirugano Kogen feature Smart Interchanges allowing temporary exit to explore nearby attractions, roadside stations, or local viewpoints, then re-enter the expressway seamlessly.
