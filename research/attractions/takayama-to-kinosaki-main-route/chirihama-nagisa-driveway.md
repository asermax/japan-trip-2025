Chirihama Nagisa Driveway (千里浜なぎさドライブウェイ) is Japan's only drivable beach, an extraordinary 8-kilometer stretch of sandy coastline along the Sea of Japan where vehicles can drive directly on the sand alongside the waves. Located on the western edge of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture, this unique attraction offers an unforgettable driving experience that combines scenic coastal beauty with the novelty of beach driving.

The beach's sand possesses extraordinary characteristics that allow it to support vehicles ranging from bicycles and motorcycles to full-size tour buses. The sand particles are exceptionally fine - measuring only 0.2mm in diameter, approximately one-quarter the size of ordinary beach sand - with uniform, angular shapes. The firmness of the driving surface results from continuous capillary action that keeps the sand moistened with seawater, creating a hardened surface under vehicle weight.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The driveway's history began serendipitously in 1955 when a local bus company employee, observing fishermen driving their trucks across the beach to transport freshly caught fish, decided to test whether a passenger bus could make the same journey. The experiment succeeded, and Chirihama Nagisa Driveway was born, eventually becoming an official public road open to all vehicles. [🔗](https://centrip-japan.com/spot/327.html)

Today, the beach has evolved into a cherished cultural landmark and serves as the goal destination for the SSTR (Sunrise Sunset Touring Rally), Japan's largest motorcycle touring event. Created by world-renowned adventurer Fukashi Kazama, the SSTR challenges riders to start from Japan's East Coast at sunrise and reach Chirihama Beach by sunset. Participation has grown from 127 riders in 2013 to over 12,000 by 2023, transforming the beach into a cultural gathering point for motorcycle enthusiasts across the nation.

## Visiting Information

**Access:** Approximately 40 minutes driving from Kanazawa via Noto Satoyama Kaido expressway. Exit at Imahama Interchange (southern entrance) when approaching from Kanazawa, or Chirihama Interchange (northern entrance) when approaching from Noto Peninsula direction. Both exits lead directly to the beach entrances. [🔗](https://kshouse.jp/articles/en/kanazawa-drivetosea/)

**Hours:** Open 24 hours daily, year-round. Weather-dependent closures during high tides, heavy rain, or stormy weather. Always check road conditions before visiting via "Ishikawa Michi Joho Net" (石川みち情報ネット). If "Chirihama Nagisa Driveway" shows "規制なし" (no restrictions) = open; "規制あり" (restrictions) = closed.

**Route Context:** Detour time from main Takayama-Kinosaki route: approximately 40 minutes each way from Kanazawa. Total detour including beach drive experience: 1.5-2 hours recommended.

**Seasonal Considerations:** Late October is an excellent time to visit - food stalls remain open through fall, offering grilled seafood specialties. Weather is typically mild, though the beach may close temporarily during stormy conditions or high tides. The sunset views are spectacular during this season, and autumn crowds are lighter than summer swimming season. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4254.html)

## The Experience

**Beach Driving:** Drive any vehicle (no 4WD required) - cars, motorcycles, bicycles all permitted. 30 km/h speed limit enforced. Bidirectional traffic along the 8km stretch. Stop anywhere to park (away from traffic flow) for photos, shell collecting, or wading in the water. The 8km beach drive takes approximately 15-20 minutes at the speed limit, but most visitors spend additional time stopping for photos and experiences.

**Safety Considerations:** Avoid white, dried-out sand areas where tires can get stuck. Never park in the surf zone - tires will sink. Watch for soft spots that are difficult to identify visually. Drive cautiously near the water's edge. [🔗](https://kodawari-times.net/regions-in-japan/chirihama-drive-way/)

**Scenic Experience:** The driveway offers breathtaking coastal scenery, particularly renowned for its spectacular sunset views over the Sea of Japan.

The scenery transforms with changing tides and weather conditions. [🔗](https://www.ishikawatravel.jp/en/spots/chirihama-nagisa-driveway/)
