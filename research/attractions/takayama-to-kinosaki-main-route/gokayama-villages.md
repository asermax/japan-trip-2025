Gokayama comprises two remarkable UNESCO World Heritage villages - Ainokura and Suganuma - located in the southwestern tip of Toyama Prefecture. These historic mountain settlements represent centuries of adaptation to one of Japan's harshest winter environments, featuring the distinctive gassho-zukuri architectural style that has been passed down through generations since the late 17th century.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The villages achieved UNESCO World Heritage status in 1995 alongside Shirakawa-go, recognized as outstanding examples of traditional human settlements perfectly adapted to their environment. Unlike the more commercialized Shirakawa-go, Gokayama maintains an intimate, authentic atmosphere with significantly fewer crowds, offering visitors a more peaceful glimpse into traditional Japanese mountain life.

The gassho-zukuri farmhouses feature steep, thatched roofs angled at 60 degrees to allow heavy snow (up to 4 meters) to slide off easily. These impressive structures, some over 400 years old, were traditionally used for silkworm cultivation in the vast attic spaces, while ground floors served families and traditional crafts like washi papermaking and nitre production.
