Higashi Chaya District (東茶屋街) stands as the largest and most prestigious of Kanazawa's three preserved geisha districts, officially established in 1820 by the Kaga Domain as an entertainment quarter for wealthy merchants and nobility. The district achieved official recognition as a Japanese cultural asset, a distinction shared only with Kyoto's Gion and Kanazawa's Kazue-machi - no other geisha districts in Japan hold this prestigious designation.

The area retains the authentic atmosphere of the Edo period (1603-1867) through its distinctive two-story wooden teahouses called "chaya." These structures are characterized by their beautiful wooden lattices on the first floor, known as "kimusuko," and elegant Japanese-style guestrooms on the second floor. During the Edo period, the construction of two-story buildings was prohibited except for geisha houses, making their appearance particularly striking and historically significant.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The district's cultural importance extends to its role as a center for Kanazawa's gold leaf production - the city manufactures nearly 100% of Japan's gold leaf, and several historic gold leaf shops and workshops operate within the district.

Geisha culture continues to thrive here, with traditional entertainment still performed in select teahouses, maintaining a living connection to the area's 200-year heritage. The designation as a Japanese cultural asset alongside Kyoto's Gion reflects the exceptional preservation of Edo-period architecture and the continuation of traditional geisha customs.
