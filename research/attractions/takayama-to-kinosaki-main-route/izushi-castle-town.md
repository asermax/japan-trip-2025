Known as "Little Kyoto of Tajima," Izushi is a remarkably preserved Edo-period castle town featuring Japan's oldest clock tower, 40+ traditional soba restaurants, samurai architecture, and traditional crafts. Designated as an Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/experiences-in-japan/190/)

Developed around Izushi Castle (built 1604 by Koide Yoshihide), the town flourished as the administrative center of Tajima Province throughout the 17th century and retains much of its historical character today. The town's most iconic landmark, the Shinkoro Clock Tower, was built in 1871 beside the remains of the main gate, originally serving as a drum tower before receiving a large clock face in 1881. This 20-meter-tall structure is recognized as Japan's oldest clock tower. [ðŸ”—](https://visitkinosaki.com/things-to-do/shinkoro-clock-tower/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Izushi's culinary fame centers on sara sobaâ€”a unique serving style where buckwheat noodles are presented on small white Izushi-ware porcelain plates, with five plates constituting one serving. This tradition began in 1706 when the Izushi Domain transferred to the Sengoku clan from Ueda in Nagano Prefecture, bringing soba artisans who introduced their craft to the region. Today, approximately 40 restaurants serve this specialty throughout the town, making Izushi the leading soba area in western Japan.

The town's traditional crafts include Izushi ware pottery, renowned as "too white color porcelain" for its exceptionally pure white appearance achieved using Kakitani pottery stone. Begun by Izuya Yazaemon in 1784 and shifting to white porcelain production in 1793 after adopting techniques from Arita, Izushi ware features surfaces so smooth they're compared to silk. The porcelain's purity is enhanced through carved surface decorations rather than painted designs, with craftsmanship requiring over 20 years of training to reach professional status.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Driving Considerations:** Arrive mid-morning (10:00-11:00 AM) for castle ruins exploration during best light, followed by lunch at soba restaurant (11:30 AM - 1:00 PM), then afternoon exploration of town attractions (1:00-3:00 PM). This 3-4 hour visit fits well within the "short detour" category while maximizing experiences. Alternative: Brief 1.5-2 hour visit focusing on Shinkoro Clock Tower, quick soba lunch, and main street walking tour if time is limited.

**Route Integration:** Izushi integrates naturally into the Takayama to Kinosaki main expressway route as a cultural and culinary stop approximately 35 minutes before reaching your Kinosaki Onsen destination. The stop provides cultural immersion in Edo-period castle town architecture and traditional crafts, creating a thematic bridge between Takayama's preserved merchant districts and Kinosaki's onsen town character.

**Budget Considerations:** Free attractions include Shinkoro Clock Tower (exterior), Izushi Castle Ruins, Arikoyama Inari Shrine, and traditional street walking tour. Affordable experiences: Eirakukan Kabuki Theater (Â¥300 adults), soba lunch (Â¥1,000-2,000 for 5-15 plates), parking (Â¥400). Budget for 3-4 hour visit: approximately Â¥2,500-4,500 per person.

**Cultural Etiquette:**
- **Soba dining:** Slurping noodles is encouraged and considered proper etiquette. Mix different condiments throughout your meal. Stack empty plates neatly. Don't feel pressured to finish enormous quantities; 5-10 plates is perfectly acceptable. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/au/news-blog/izushi-sara-soba/)
- **Shrine visits:** Remove hats before ascending torii gate pathway. Bow slightly when passing through torii gates. Photography allowed but be respectful during prayers.
