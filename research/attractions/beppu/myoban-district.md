*The traditional thatched-roof yunohana-goya huts at Myoban Onsen, where mineral bath salts have been produced using hot spring steam for over 300 years*

Myoban District is the highest-elevation onsen area among Beppu's renowned eight hot spring districts (Beppu Hatto), nestled in scenic mountain foothills at 350 meters above sea level. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenArea/detail_1124.html) The district's most iconic feature is the Yunohana-goya - traditional thatched-roof huts where natural bath salts (yunohana) have been produced using steam from hot springs for over 300 years. [ðŸ”—](https://300th.yuno-hana.jp/en/)

This unique manufacturing method, unchanged since the Edo period (1725), was designated as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property of Japan in 2006, and the landscape itself became a National Important Cultural Landscape in 2012. [ðŸ”—](https://jigoku-prin.com/en/myoubanjigoku/index.html) Myoban Yunosato was founded by Yoshisuke Wakiya, who initially produced high-quality alum before transitioning to yunohana (hot spring mineral powder) manufacturing. [ðŸ”—](https://300th.yuno-hana.jp/en/) This 16-generation family business celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2025, preserving a "world's only manufacturing method" found nowhere else on Earth. [ðŸ”—](https://yuno-hana.jp/en/facility/index01.html)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The yunohana production technique represents one of Japan's most remarkable examples of sustainable natural resource utilization. Inside the distinctive triangular-shaped thatched huts, craftsmen spread blue clay containing iron and aluminum compounds (montmorillonite) found exclusively in the Myoban area over cobblestone floors. [ðŸ”—](https://www.okamotoya.net/yunohana/en/) As volcanic steam gushes up from underground at 35Â°C (after cooling through stone layers from much higher temperatures), it permeates the blue clay, and mineral components crystallize slowly at approximately 1mm per day, taking 40-60 days for sufficient growth before harvesting. [ðŸ”—](http://oitaisan.com/english/heritage/myouban-hot-springs-yu-no-hana-mineral-deposit-huts/)

Historically, yunohana (alum) served diverse purposes beyond bathing: as a hemostatic agent in traditional medicine, as a mordant in textile dyeing since 700 AD (essential for imperial garment colors), in the dousa sizing process for painting and calligraphy surfaces, and even in paint and gunpowder production. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tanbo-cho.com/story/en/vol002/) The Matsuyama clan derived significant income from myoban (alum) production during the Edo period. [ðŸ”—](https://yuno-hana.jp/) At the production peak around 1930, approximately 300 yunohana-goya dotted the landscape; today, about 15 active huts remain, maintained by six dedicated artisans and the 16-generation Wakiya family. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/myoban-yunosato-soak-in-silky-blue-hot-springs-among-traditional-japanese-huts/)

The thatched roof - constructed entirely from straw, cogon grass, bamboo, and timber without any nails - plays a critical functional role by maintaining constant temperature and humidity, absorbing moisture inside and releasing it outside to prevent water droplets from forming on the crystals. [ðŸ”—](https://jigoku-prin.com/en/myoubanjigoku/index.html) It takes 40-60 days for yunohana to grow sufficiently for harvesting, refining, and drying before becoming a finished product. [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-14402185/)

The resulting yunohana crystals, resembling delicate white "flowers," are 100% natural with no chemicals or additives, containing various minerals beneficial for skin health and therapeutic bathing. [ðŸ”—](https://www.okamotoya.net/kiwami/en/story/) Approximately 15 triangular-roofed huts are scattered across the spacious grounds, creating an atmosphere transporting visitors back to the Edo period. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/myoban-yunosato-soak-in-silky-blue-hot-springs-among-traditional-japanese-huts/)

The unique landscape of yunohana huts lined up between traditional Beppu stone walls, enveloped in characteristic sulfur smell and billowing white steam, has been selected as an Important Cultural Landscape of Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenArea/detail_1124.html)
