## The Experience

[ðŸ”—](https://global-suginoi.orixhotelsandresorts.com/LUC2ORISUG/cdata/luc2orisug_5_jaen.html)

**November Seasonal Considerations:**

Early November marks the transition from autumn to early winter in Beppu, offering ideal conditions for rooftop onsen bathing. Daytime temperatures create perfect contrast between crisp outdoor air and steaming hot spring waters. Early November typically brings clear skies with excellent visibility across Beppu Bay to Shikoku Island, creating optimal conditions for panoramic photography and sunset viewing.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Optimal Visit Strategy:**

Arrive 30-45 minutes before sunset (approximately 4:30-4:45 PM in early November) to secure position in outdoor pools before peak sunset viewing time. This timing allows exploration of indoor facilities first, followed by outdoor soaking during the most spectacular lighting conditions, concluding with night views of illuminated Beppu cityscape.

**Cultural Etiquette - Traditional Onsen Rules:**

Tanayu follows traditional Japanese onsen etiquette despite its modern facilities. Swimsuits are NOT allowed in Tanayu bathing areas (gender-separated traditional onsen). Before entering any bath, thoroughly wash your entire body at the washing stations provided. Use the small towel for modesty while walking, but never allow it to touch the bath water. Enter baths slowly to avoid splashing. Hair must be tied up to prevent contact with water. [ðŸ”—](https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0002861/)

**Tattoo Policy:**

Suginoi Hotel restricts access to public bathing facilities for individuals with visible tattoos. However, guests with small tattoos may be permitted entry to The Aqua Garden if tattoos are covered with adhesive patches (available for purchase). Contact the hotel in advance if you have tattoos to discuss options.
