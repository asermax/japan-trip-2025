## Basic Information

Beppu Station Market represents authentic local shopping culture, functioning as a retro shopping arcade under the elevated Beppu Station that serves as a "veritable pantry for the residents of Beppu." [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-t9721/) This nostalgic Showa-era marketplace focuses primarily on fresh food and local meals, offering travelers a genuine glimpse into daily Beppu life rather than tourist-oriented souvenir shopping.

## Cultural & Historical Context

Originally established under the railroad tracks on both sides of Beppu Station, the market was historically full of souvenirs, foods, drinks and small eateries. Following Beppu Station renovation in the late 1990s, the remaining market transformed into an open fruit, vegetable, and meat market that remains one of the cheapest places to get produce in Beppu.
