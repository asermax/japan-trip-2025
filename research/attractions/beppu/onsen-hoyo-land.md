Onsen Hoyo Land (別府温泉保養ランド), also known as Beppu Onsen Hoyoland, is one of Beppu's most unique and sought-after hot spring facilities, offering an authentic volcanic mud bathing experience that has remained largely unchanged for generations. Located in the Myoban district on the slopes above Beppu city, this facility draws its therapeutic waters from the Konya Jigoku ("Indigo Hell") source, named for the deep blue color the spring water once displayed. [🔗](https://hoyoland.net/)

The facility is celebrated for its expansive outdoor mud baths where natural volcanic mud accumulates at the bottom of the pools, creating a thick, mineral-rich sediment that visitors enthusiastically apply to their entire bodies. This slightly run-down yet atmospheric public bath complex has become an onsen enthusiast's favorite, offering an experience that feels authentically connected to Japan's traditional hot spring culture. Despite—or perhaps because of—its rustic, aged appearance reminiscent of the Meiji era, the facility maintains its reputation as "Nishi-yokozuna, the best spa in western Japan."

The volcanic mud at Hoyo Land is particularly prized for its high concentration of minerals including iron and aluminum, with water acidity reaching pH 2.5. These properties provide exceptional therapeutic benefits for skin conditions, with the strong acidity offering natural antibacterial and disinfecting effects. The cobalt blue colloidal sulfur spring is said to be highly effective at treating skin ailments and improving complexion, while the mud itself acts as both an exfoliant and a nourishing mask.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The Myoban district itself holds special cultural significance as the only place in the world where traditional yu-no-hana (hot spring mineral crystals) are harvested using centuries-old methods in distinctive thatched-roof huts. This area was designated a nationally Important Intangible Folk Cultural Asset in 2006 and a National Important Cultural Landscape in 2012, celebrating 300 years of yu-no-hana production since 1725.

Onsen Hoyo Land represents the raw, authentic side of Beppu's hot spring culture—a facility that prioritizes traditional therapeutic experiences over modern luxury. The rustic appearance and aged facilities are intentional, maintaining the character of traditional Japanese hot spring bathing from the Meiji era. This authenticity has made it a pilgrimage site for serious onsen enthusiasts seeking genuine thermal therapy experiences.

**Step-by-Step Mud Bath Process:**

1. **Arrival & Entry:** Store valuables in provided lockers (use lockers for all valuables) [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r357274857-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

2. **Preparation:** Remove all jewelry and metal accessories before bathing - the high iron and aluminum concentration will permanently darken metallic items (except gold and platinum). Rinse body thoroughly before entering any bath. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r357274857-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

3. **Initial Soak:** Begin with the regular hot spring baths to acclimate to the temperature and relax muscles (10-15 minutes)

4. **Mud Application:** Enter the mud bath pools carefully (floors are very slippery). Scoop thick mud from the bottom of the pool and generously apply it all over your body. The mud acts as both an exfoliant and nourishing mask. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/hoyolandonsen/)

5. **Mud Bath Soak:** Remain in the mud bath for 15-30 minutes, allowing the mineral-rich mud to work its therapeutic effects. Limit initial soaks to 10-15 minutes to avoid overheating. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r469623527-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

6. **Rinse & Repeat:** Rinse off mud with water only (no soap or shampoo available). You can alternate between different mud pools and the colloidal sulfur bath. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r357274857-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

7. **Final Experience:** Use the outdoor steam room for final detoxification and thoroughly rinse off all mud residue before leaving

**What to Expect:**
- Your skin will feel noticeably softer, smoother, and more supple after the mud treatment
- The facility is rustic and aged - expect a very natural, raw onsen experience "like being in the Meiji era of Japan"
- The outdoor baths are surrounded by nature with steamy volcanic landscapes
- The intense sulfur smell will linger on your skin and clothing for up to a week [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r819892416-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Essential Preparation:**

What to Bring:
- Old clothing that you don't mind getting permanently scented with sulfur - the potent smell will linger for up to a week [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r819892416-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)
- Your own towel for drying off (or purchase one at facility)
- Drinking water for hydration

What NOT to Bring/Wear:
- Remove ALL metallic jewelry, watches, and accessories before bathing - the high mineral content will permanently darken metal items (except gold and platinum) [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r357274857-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

**Safety & Health Considerations:**

- Children under junior high age are prohibited from the mud baths due to water pressure and intensity [🔗](https://beppu-midoubaru.jp/en/hoyoland-onsen-a-unique-mud-bath-experience-in-beppu-2/)
- Baths have intense heat retention - limit soaks to 10-15 minutes initially to avoid overheating
- Move slowly and carefully - floors and pool bottoms are VERY slippery [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r469623527-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

**Mixed-Gender Area Etiquette:**

- In the outdoor mixed area, men and women are separated by a simple bamboo railing while sharing the same water
- Do NOT stand up in the outdoor baths to maintain modesty
- Do NOT walk over the bridge outside as you will be visible to the other gender's section [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298219-d3595627-r469623527-Beppu_Onsen_Hoyo_Land_Konya_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

**November Seasonal Considerations:**

Early November offers ideal weather for mud bathing with cool temperatures (10-16°C) creating dramatic steam effects and making the hot thermal waters especially inviting. Autumn foliage may be visible in nearby mountains while bathing. Morning visits offer the most dramatic steam effects as cool morning air meets hot spring water.
