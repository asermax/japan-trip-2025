Oniishibozu Jigoku, or "Shaven Monk's Head Hell," is one of Beppu's oldest and most culturally significant hot springs, dating back over 1,200 years with records in the 733 CE Bungo Fudoki. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/oniishi-bozu-jikoku/) The site features approximately five ponds of boiling gray mud heated to 99°C (210°F) that continuously bubble and burst, creating shapes resembling Buddhist monks' shaven heads emerging from the earth. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), it was known as "Buddhist Hell," reflecting deep cultural connections to Buddhist concepts of the afterlife.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The name "Oniishibozu" carries profound Buddhist symbolism. "Bōzu" means Buddhist monk, and "Oniishi" references demon stones. The bubbling mud rises to the surface and bursts, creating round shapes that remarkably resemble the shaven heads of Buddhist monks, connecting this natural phenomenon with Buddhist religious imagery and traditional associations between geothermal activity and hellish realms in Japanese spiritual culture. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-oniishibozu-jigoku)

Historically, the volcanic activity that scattered hot mud across the Kannawa area made it impossible to grow rice, transforming what was once inhospitable land into one of Japan's premier tourist destinations. The mud pools emit sounds described as resembling "a demon's snore," adding to the otherworldly Buddhist hell imagery. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/oniishi-bozu-jikoku/)

## The Oniishibozu Jigoku Experience

### The Bubbling Mud Pools

The main attraction features approximately five distinct pools of gray boiling mud. Visitors observe the hypnotic, continuous bubbling action as superheated mud rises to the surface at 99°C, creating dome-shaped bubbles that burst and reform constantly. The pools emit occasional sounds described as demonic snoring, adding to the otherworldly atmosphere. The gray coloration comes from mineral-rich volcanic sediments mixed with thermal waters. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/oniishi-bozu-jikoku/)

**Photography opportunities:** Gray mud pools create striking visual compositions, especially in morning light. The contrast between bubbling mud and surrounding landscaped gardens provides excellent photo opportunities. Steam is most photogenic in cooler morning hours. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-oniishibozu-jigoku)

### Free Foot Bath (Ashiyu)

Oniishibozu Jigoku offers a complimentary circular foot bath facility filled with cooled thermal spring water from the same source that feeds the mud pools. The unique circular design encourages social interaction among visitors. The foot bath provides a perfect way to relax while viewing the geothermal landscape, especially pleasant after walking between the Kannawa area hells.

### Oniishi no Yu Hot Spring Bath

**Unique feature:** Oniishibozu Jigoku is the only hell where visitors can actually bathe in the thermal waters. The adjacent Oniishi no Yu bathhouse, fed by the same geothermal spring that creates the mud pools, offers a complete onsen experience.
