Seikichi Udon is a long-established traditional udon and soba restaurant located along the Yamanami Highway (Route 11) in Beppu. The restaurant is part of the Seikichi Chaya group, which operates multiple locations in the Oita region including Yufuin. Known for its carefully prepared dashi (broth) and regional specialties, Seikichi Udon offers an authentic taste of Oita's noodle culture with a focus on both local ingredients and traditional preparation methods. [🔗](http://www.seikichi-chaya.com/seikitiudon.html)

The restaurant specializes in udon noodles with a smooth, slippery texture (ツルリン系) that exemplifies the Kyushu style of noodle preparation. The dashi is the restaurant's pride, made carefully with katsuobushi (bonito flakes), iriko (dried sardines), and kombu (kelp), creating a clear, refined broth that forms the foundation of their dishes.

Beyond udon, Seikichi Udon serves as a gateway to experiencing Oita's famous regional specialties, including toriten (chicken tempura) and dangojiru (dumpling miso soup), both integral to the prefecture's food culture. [🔗](http://www.seikichi-chaya.com/seikitiudon.html)

## Signature Dishes & Specialties

### Kurome Udon (クロメうどん)

The restaurant's standout specialty featuring kurome seaweed from Saganoseki (佐賀関産のクロメ), a type of brown kelp local to the Oita coast. The abundant kurome gives the noodles an extra slippery, smooth texture that enhances the traditional udon experience. This dish represents the intersection of Beppu's coastal location and its noodle tradition. [🔗](https://retty.me/area/PRE44/ARE279/SUB13802/100001154634/)

### Kurome Set with Shirasu Rice (¥960)

A luxurious combination showcasing two local specialties: kurome seaweed from Saganoseki and shirasu (whitebait) from Beppu Bay. The shirasu represents 70% of Oita Prefecture's production and is branded as "Bungo Beppu Wan Chirimen" when dried. The fresh boiled shirasu (kama-age shirasu) served here has a plumper texture than the dried variety. Reviewers note it's excellent to find a full set meal under ¥1,000.

This combination showcases both the coastal (shirasu from Beppu Bay) and traditional noodle culture (kurome-enhanced udon). [🔗](https://tabelog.com/en/oita/A4402/A440202/44001707/)

### Cultural Etiquette

- Japanese noodle etiquette encourages slurping, which aerates the broth and enhances flavor while showing appreciation to the chef
- It's acceptable to finish the meal relatively quickly; udon restaurants are designed for efficient service
- If ordering set meals, eat the rice and side dishes alongside the noodles rather than sequentially

## Cultural Context

### About Kurome Seaweed

Kurome (Ecklonia kurome) is a brown kelp species that grows in the seas around Kyushu and southern Japan. It's valued for its superior taste compared to related seaweeds and adds a luxurious slippery texture to noodles. While not unique to Oita, its use in Seikichi Udon's signature dish reflects the restaurant's commitment to regional coastal ingredients. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecklonia_kurome)

### About Beppu Bay Shirasu

Beppu Bay produces 70% of Oita Prefecture's shirasu catch, making it a defining local specialty. The nutrient-rich waters where the inland sea meets the Pacific create ideal conditions for whitebait. Fresh boiled shirasu (kama-age shirasu) is prized for its plump texture and delicate flavor. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/oita/beppu-seafood-delight/44414)

### The Seikichi Group

Seikichi operates multiple locations across Oita Prefecture, including Seikichi Chaya in Yufuin (near Yufuin Station), maintaining consistent quality standards while adapting to each location's character. [🔗](https://tabelog.com/en/oita/A4402/A440201/44001708/)

## Seasonal Considerations

**Early November:** Comfortable for dining, with pleasant autumn temperatures. The Yamanami Highway route offers beautiful autumn foliage views during this period, making the journey to the restaurant scenic. Fresh shirasu is available year-round from Beppu Bay. [🔗](https://en.japantravel.com/oita/beppu-seafood-delight/44414)

**Optimal Timing:** Excellent lunch option when traveling between Beppu and Yufuin or other mountain destinations. Can serve as a convenient stop before or after visiting the Yamanami Highway scenic areas.

## Nearby Attractions & Integration

**Yamanami Highway (Route 11):** The scenic mountain route connecting Beppu and Aso, passing through Aso-Kuju National Park with spectacular plateau views and mountain landscapes. The restaurant's location makes it an ideal stopping point for this route. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4571.html)

**Kannawa Onsen District:** 10-15 minutes away, the cultural heart of Beppu's hot spring culture with steam vents, jigoku-mushi cooking facilities, and traditional bathhouses.

**Culinary Context within Beppu:** Seikichi Udon complements the city's onsen-focused dining experiences (like jigoku-mushi cooking) by offering traditional noodle culture. After steam-cooked meals in Kannawa, the restaurant provides a different perspective on Oita's food heritage.

**Connection to Regional Food Culture:** The restaurant serves as an introduction to multiple Oita specialties (toriten, dangojiru, shirasu) in one location, making it efficient for understanding the prefecture's culinary identity beyond Beppu's onsen-specific dishes.
