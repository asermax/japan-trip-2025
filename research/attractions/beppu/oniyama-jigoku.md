Oniyama Jigoku, also known as "Crocodile Hell" or "Demon Mountain Hell," is one of Beppu's Seven Hells and stands out as the most unique, combining geological phenomena with a remarkable zoological achievement. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-oniyama-jigoku) The facility holds historical significance as Japan's first crocodile breeding facility to utilize hot spring heat, established in 1923 during the Taisho period. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri)

The springs bubble at a scorching 99.1Â°C (210Â°F), creating dramatic scenes of steam and vibrant green waters that provide ideal habitat for approximately 80 crocodiles and alligators. The breeding program originally began around 1918 when reptiles were first raised using the intense heat and high humidity created by the 98Â°C spring water. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-oniyama-jigoku) The crocodiles, originally brought from Malaysia, thrive in this geothermal environment despite Beppu's four-season climate, growing faster than they would in the wild.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

While hot springs have been used for centuries for bathing and healing in Japan, Oniyama Jigoku represents a creative 20th-century innovationâ€”a modern adaptation of natural resources for conservation and tourism purposes. The name "Oniyama" translates to "Demon Mountain," aligning with the general theme of Beppu's "hells," which historically were viewed with fear and reverence as powerful, otherworldly geothermal sites. [ðŸ”—](https://gemini-p-research-2025-09-30)

The facility presents itself as a place of conservation and education, with breeding programs aimed at protecting endangered crocodile species. Educational exhibits include crocodile skeletons, taxidermy specimens, and displays about the history of crocodile breeding in Beppu and reptile biology. Notable specimens include stuffed specimens of the first crocodile "Ichiro" and Indian gharials designated as endangered species.

The monument of a seated demon (oni) at the entrance has become a popular photo spot. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri)
