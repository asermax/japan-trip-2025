The Beppu Bay Waterfront District encompasses the Kitahama area, a bustling coastal zone located along Beppu Bay at the eastern edge of Beppu's downtown area. This district offers a distinct coastal atmosphere compared to the inland onsen districts, combining scenic bay views, fresh seafood dining, coastal walking paths, and waterfront hot spring experiences. The area serves as both a transportation gateway (with the International Tourist Port and ferry terminal) and a leisure destination with parks, observation decks, and waterfront dining.

The waterfront is characterized by its quiet, relaxed atmosphere, particularly in the early morning and around sunset. Unlike the steamy, mountainous onsen districts inland, Kitahama offers fresh sea breezes, expansive ocean views across Beppu Bay, and a distinctly coastal character. The district is designed to be walkable and cyclable, with seaside promenades, coastal parks, and barrier-free pathways connecting the various waterfront attractions.

### Seafood Dining

The Kitahama waterfront district is the premier area for fresh seafood dining in Beppu, with restaurants specializing in local catches from the active fishing industry in Beppu Bay.

**Local Seafood Specialties:**

**Seki-aji and Seki-saba** are the crown jewels of Beppu seafood. These premium horse mackerel (aji) and mackerel (saba) are caught in the swift tidal currents off Saganoseki using traditional one-by-one fishing techniques. The fish develop small heads, high fat content, and can be eaten raw as sashimi with minimal parasite risk. Seki-aji peaks in summer, while seki-saba is best from autumn to winter - perfect for November visits.

**Shiroshita-karei** (white belly flounder) grows in Beppu Bay where fresh water springs up in the sea near Hinode Castle. This marbled flounder was historically valued as tribute to the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Edo period. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/stories/seafoods)

## Practical Visiting Tips

### November Visit Considerations

Early November is an excellent time to visit the waterfront, with comfortable temperatures for coastal walks, clear autumn skies for bay views, and optimal conditions for outdoor dining.
