The geothermal steam vents of Beppu, particularly concentrated in the Kannawa and Myoban districts, represent one of Japan's most dramatic urban geothermal landscapes. Kannawa is directly built on a large swath of steaming ground, with steam rising everywhere throughout narrow, winding streets, creating an atmospheric and photogenic environment. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

The area features over 2,909 hot spring vents within Beppu city, accounting for more than 10% of Japan's total hot spring vents. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Onsen) More than 130,000 tons of hot spring water gushes from the ground every day, making Beppu the second largest hot spring water discharge location in the world and the largest in Japan. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Onsen)

The scenery of Kannawa Onsen was designated as a Nationally Important Cultural Landscape in 2012, recognizing its unique integration of geothermal features into daily urban life. [🔗](http://oitaisan.com/english/heritage/the-steam-of-kannawa-hot-springs/)

## Cultural & Geological Significance

**Urban Geothermal Integration:**

Steam spews in dramatic, billowing clouds from hot-spring vents into the sky, with wisps of steam hissing from drain pipes and cracks in the road throughout the Kannawa and Myoban districts. [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-hell-steaming) British photographer Herbert George Ponting described in the early 20th century how "the crust of the earth is so impregnated with volcanic heat that almost anywhere steam can be tapped by punching a hole in the ground with a crow-bar," noting that "nearly every house has a set of holes outside it, which are used for cooking purposes." [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-hell-steaming)

Kannawa is sometimes referred to as the "birthplace of Beppu Hot Springs" and features numerous jets of white steam emitting from gushing hot springs. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Onsen) The lower part of Kannawa, accessible by walking down Ideyu Slope (Ideyu-zaka) from the bus station, breathes both history and hot steam wherever you go. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

**Jigoku-gama (Hell Ovens):**

Throughout the Kannawa neighborhood, large box-like chambers made of brick or concrete with rows of wooden lids on top serve as jigoku-gama or "hell ovens." [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-hell-steaming) These structures channel 98°C geothermal steam from underground fumaroles, creating public and private cooking facilities that residents and visitors use daily. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/stories/jigokumushi)

The cooking method, known as jigoku-mushi (hell-steaming), dates back to before the Edo period and utilizes 100% geothermal energy. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/plan-your-trip/to-know/japanese-food/jigoku-mushi-cuisine) Restaurants and shops display their jigoku-gama setups out front - stone or concrete cooking spots into which steam is piped from below. [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-hell-steaming)

**Myoban Yunohana Huts:**

Myoban Onsen, the northeasternmost of the Beppu Eight onsen districts, welcomes visitors with ethereal white vapors rising from traditional straw-covered "yunohana huts." [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Onsen) These thatched-roof structures are unique to Myoban and were designated a nationally Important Intangible Folk Cultural Asset in 2006 and a National Important Cultural Landscape in 2012. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/myoban-yunosato-soak-in-silky-blue-hot-springs-among-traditional-japanese-huts/)

Small stones called kuri-ishi are spread where steam is especially strong, covered with special blue clay found only in this area, then topped with a thatched triangular roof. The thatched roof maintains constant internal temperatures by absorbing and releasing humidity, allowing mineral deposits to grow about 1mm per day as beneficial mineral components from Myoban's hot spring steam crystallize. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/myoban-yunosato-soak-in-silky-blue-hot-springs-among-traditional-japanese-huts/)

**Geological Formation:**

The hot springs and steam vents formed approximately 50,000 years ago. Rainwater percolates through volcanic rock via fault lines - the Asamigawa fault on the south side of the Beppu alluvial fan and the Kannawa fault on the northside - taking approximately 50 years to reach the volcanic heat source before generating enough steam to emerge at the surface.

## The Steam Vent Experience

**Street-Side Steam Exploration:**

Walk through Kannawa's narrow, labyrinthine streets where thick steam wafts from drains set in the pavement, steam jets from salt-encrusted concrete and metal contraptions, and atmospheric clouds obscure and reveal the historic streetscape. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu) The concentration of steam clouds is visible from arriving trains, making Kannawa unmistakable. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

Hidden back alley spots offer 360° views of hot springs and serve as exceptional photo locations. [🔗](https://travel-beppu.com/en/tourism/kannawa/) The main street features nine public bathhouses and leads to Miyukizaka and Jigoku Meguri Street, creating a network of steam-filled alleyways perfect for exploration.

Volunteers assist guests in operating the steam cookers. The facility provides tea, utensils, and condiments, with indoor and outdoor seating available. No seasoning is needed as the steam contains minerals from the hot spring water, giving food a slightly salty taste. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/stories/jigokumushi)

**Wait Times:** Weekends and holidays can have 2-3 hour wait times. Visit on weekdays or arrive early to avoid crowds. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

**Street-Side Steam Cooking:**

Throughout Kannawa, tiny corner shops display eggs and sweet potatoes steamed in hot spring steam on wooden racks outside. These traditional snacks provide an authentic taste of jigoku-mushi cooking without needing to visit specialized facilities. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

**Myoban Yunohana Huts:**

Visit the traditional thatched-roof yunohana production huts at Myoban Yunosato, the only place in the world where these structures exist. Watch the centuries-old process of natural bath salt production using geothermal steam and blue clay. Myoban is also known for jigoku-mushi purin (steamed crème caramel) from local shops utilizing geothermal steam.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Early November Seasonal Advantages:**

Cooler November temperatures (12-22°C / 54-72°F daytime) create dramatically increased steam visibility as warm geothermal steam meets cooler air. Early morning visits feature especially thick, foggy steam-filled alleyways. [🔗](https://weather.com/travel/news/hell-steamy-japanese-town-beppu)

November is one of the months with lowest precipitation in Beppu, with only 5-7 days of rain or snow expected, making it ideal for outdoor steam vent exploration. Autumn also offers pleasant temps ranging from 12-22°C. [🔗](https://championtraveler.com/dates/best-time-to-visit-beppu-jp/)

**Best Photography Times:**
- **Early Morning (6:00-8:00 AM):** Maximum steam visibility in coolest air, soft morning light
- **Golden Hour (4:00-5:30 PM):** Warm light enhancing steam clouds
- **Night (after 6:00 PM):** Street lights create orange glow through steam, mysterious atmosphere
[🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/wonderlandkannawa/)

**Prime Photography Locations:**
- Ideyu-zaka main street with steam rising along the slope
- Hidden back alleys with 360° steam vent views
