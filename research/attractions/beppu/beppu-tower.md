Beppu Tower is a 100-meter-tall observation tower that has stood as a landmark of Beppu City since its completion in 1957. The tower was designed by renowned architect Tachu Naito, the same visionary behind Tokyo Tower and Tsutenkaku, making it one of Japan's celebrated "Six Tower Brothers" - a collection of historic towers sharing similar architectural heritage.

Originally planned to open for the Beppu Tourism Exhibition, construction was completed on May 10, 1957, just ten days before the exhibition ended. In October 2007, the tower received recognition as a National Registered Tangible Cultural Property, cementing its status as an important cultural landmark.

The tower underwent a major renovation in 2023, being repainted in its original gray color to authentically reflect its construction era. It now stands at its original height of 100 meters with an extended lightning rod. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/attractions/detail_1016.html)

## Cultural & Architectural Significance

From its dual observation decks on the 16th and 17th floors, positioned 55 meters above ground, visitors enjoy sweeping 360-degree panoramic views of Beppu City, Beppu Bay, and on clear days, views extending as far as Shikoku island. The magnificent panorama encompasses ocean, mountains, and the distinctive steam plumes rising from Beppu's famous hot spring resorts. [ðŸ”—](https://bepputower.co.jp/en/tower/)

At night, Beppu Tower transforms into an illuminated spectacle, displaying various colors and patterns that change with the seasons and special events. The tower is officially designated as a Category III Illuminated Night View Heritage site by the Japan Night View Heritage organization, and in 2023 it was recognized as part of Japan's Nightscape Heritage.

Beyond its function as an observation tower, Beppu Tower represents an important piece of Japan's post-war tourism development and architectural heritage. Its designation as a National Registered Tangible Cultural Property and its place among Japan's "Six Tower Brothers" add cultural value beyond simple sightseeing.

The tower features two observation levels at 55 meters above ground, offering complete 360-degree panoramic views. From this vantage point, visitors can observe the urban layout of Beppu City, the expanse of Beppu Bay stretching toward the horizon, and on exceptionally clear days, views extending to Shikoku island across the strait. One of the tower's unique viewing features is the ability to spot steam plumes continuously rising from Beppu's numerous hot spring resorts throughout the city, providing a visual reminder of the geothermal activity beneath.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Early November Seasonal Considerations:**
- **Weather:** November typically offers excellent visibility with lower humidity compared to summer months; clear days are common in autumn
- **Temperature:** Comfortable viewing conditions with daytime temperatures around 15-20Â°C (59-68Â°F); light jacket recommended for evening visits
- **Autumn Foliage:** From the observation deck, potential to spot autumn colors in surrounding mountains, particularly Mount Tsurumi and the Kuju range in the distance
- **Sunset Timing:** In early November, sunset occurs around 5:15-5:30 PM, making late afternoon visits (4:30-6:00 PM) ideal for capturing both daylight and twilight views

**Best Photography Spots:**
- Main observation deck (16th-17th floors) for panoramic city and bay views
- Kitahama Deck for upward architectural shots of the tower structure
- Evening visits for illuminated cityscape photography
- Clear day visits for distant mountain and Shikoku views

**Crowd Avoidance Strategies:**
- Visit during weekday mornings (9:30-11:00 AM) for quietest experience
- Avoid weekend afternoons when local visitors are most numerous
- Early evening (4:30-6:00 PM) offers moderate crowds with excellent lighting conditions

**Money-Saving Options:**
- Standard observation deck admission (Â¥800) provides full panoramic viewing experience
- Kitahama Deck offers more affordable viewing option (Â¥200) though with less elevation
- Combo ticket saves Â¥500 if planning to visit both observation deck and art museum

**Comparison with Mount Tsurumi Ropeway:**
- **Beppu Tower advantages:** More convenient location (walking distance from station), cheaper admission, quick visit duration, available in all weather, night viewing option
- **Mount Tsurumi advantages:** Superior elevation (1,375m vs 55m observation height), more expansive mountain and coastal views, hiking opportunities, seasonal beauty (autumn foliage, spring flowers), more memorable experience overall
- **Recommendation:** Mount Tsurumi generally offers more spectacular views and experience value; Beppu Tower is better for time-constrained visitors, evening/night viewing, or those seeking urban perspective [ðŸ”—](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298219-d3237917-Reviews-Beppu_Ropeway-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

**Weather Preparation:**
- Check visibility forecast before visiting for best views
- Bring light jacket for observation deck (can be breezy at 55m elevation)
- Cloudy or rainy days significantly diminish viewing experience
- Consider visiting on clearest day of your stay for optimal visibility

**Value Assessment:**

Visitor reviews present mixed opinions on value relative to the Â¥800 admission price. Some consider it worthwhile for the panoramic views and cultural significance as a heritage property, while others suggest it's more of a secondary attraction compared to Mount Tsurumi Ropeway. The tower appears most valuable for visitors interested in architectural landmarks, those seeking convenient urban viewpoints, or couples interested in the romantic Kitahama Deck experience.
