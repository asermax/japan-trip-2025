## Cultural & Historical Significance

Myoban Yunosato represents 300 years of continuous yunohana production, with approximately 15 triangular-roofed thatched huts scattered across spacious mountain grounds creating an atmosphere that transports visitors to the Edo period. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/myoban-yunosato-soak-in-silky-blue-hot-springs-among-traditional-japanese-huts/) The production technique, designated as a National Important Intangible Cultural Asset in 2006, involves hot spring vapor permeating blue clay floors inside specially designed straw-thatched huts, creating 100% natural mineral crystals over 40-60 days. [ðŸ”—](https://yuno-hana.jp/en/)

The thatched roofs absorb humidity to maintain constant interior temperatures, a technique perfected over 300 years. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenArea/detail_1124.html) Mineral crystals grow approximately 1mm per day as beneficial components from hot spring steam and blue clay crystallize.
