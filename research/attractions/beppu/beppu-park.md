Beppu Park serves as a serene urban oasis in the heart of Japan's premier onsen city, offering a peaceful contrast to the geothermal activity that defines the surrounding area. Established in 1979 on the former site of Camp Chicamauga, an Allied Occupation regional headquarters that operated from 1945 to 1957, the park represents a transformation from military installation to community green space. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu)

The park encompasses extensive natural features including approximately 700 pine trees, a distinctive bamboo forest, plum tree groves, and beautifully manicured traditional Japanese garden elements such as ponds and bridges. [ðŸ”—](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-13800177/) Wide open green spaces and well-maintained paved paths make it accessible for visitors of all mobility levels, while maintaining an authentic local character that attracts few international tourists.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The park's cultural significance extends through its connection to Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, whose works are featured as part of the public art collection, blending natural park spaces with modern sculptural art. [ðŸ”—](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Beppu_Park) Located just 15 minutes' walk from Beppu Station in the city center, it provides an ideal respite for both local residents and travelers seeking a moment of tranquility between onsen experiences.

The transformation from Camp Chicamauga to public park reflects Japan's post-war reconstruction and the integration of formerly occupied land back into community use. The park now serves as a gathering place for locals and a green lung in the urban environment, maintaining traditional Japanese landscaping principles while providing modern recreational facilities.

**Realistic Expectations:**

- Best appreciated as a complement to Beppu's onsen experiences rather than a standalone destination

**Alternative Consideration:**
If seeking more dramatic autumn foliage viewing, consider Mt. Tsurumi via Beppu Ropeway, which offers spectacular mountain foliage from mid-October through November with panoramic views.
