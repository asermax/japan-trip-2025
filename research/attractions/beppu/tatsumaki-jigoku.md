Tatsumaki Jigoku (龍巻地獄), meaning "Tornado Hell" or "Spout Hell," is the only geyser among the Seven Hells of Beppu and one of Japan's most unique geothermal attractions. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html) This rare natural phenomenon is designated as both a National Place of Scenic Beauty and a city-designated natural monument. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri) The geyser erupts with remarkable regularity every 30-40 minutes, shooting scalding hot water up to 50 meters into the air (though a protective roof structure currently limits visible height to approximately 30 meters for visitor safety).

Located in the Shibaseki District of Beppu, Tatsumaki Jigoku is positioned immediately adjacent to Chinoike Jigoku (Blood Pond Hell), making it convenient to visit both attractions in a single trip. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html)

## Cultural & Geological Significance

Known as the oldest natural hell in Japan, this geothermal wonder showcases the raw power of Beppu's volcanic landscape. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri) The geyser's eruptions occur when underground hydrothermal water, heated to approximately 150 degrees Celsius deep beneath the surface, builds sufficient pressure to explosively vaporize and burst upward through a narrow vent. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/tatsumaki-jigoku/) Each eruption lasts between 6-10 minutes, creating a spectacular display of boiling water and steam that visitors can observe from a safe, covered viewing platform equipped with seating. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html)

Unlike the famous geysers of Yellowstone, Iceland, or New Zealand—which may erupt irregularly or at extended intervals—Tatsumaki Jigoku maintains an extraordinarily reliable schedule, erupting approximately every 30-40 minutes throughout the day. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/tatsumaki-jigoku/) This predictability allows visitors to efficiently plan their time, often checking the eruption schedule at the entrance and visiting the neighboring Chinoike Jigoku during the waiting period.

## The Geyser Experience

The centerpiece attraction is witnessing the geyser's powerful eruption cycle. Upon arrival, check the posted eruption schedule at the entrance to know when the next eruption will occur. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html) Find a seat on one of the provided benches or terraces in the covered viewing area—front-row seats offer the most dramatic experience but fill quickly.

As the eruption approaches, you'll begin to feel intense heat radiating from the geyser vent even from several meters away. [🔗](https://beppu-midoubaru.jp/en/tatsumaki-hell/) The eruption itself is a 6-10 minute spectacle of boiling water and steam shooting upward with tremendous force, accompanied by rumbling sounds from the underground geothermal activity. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html) The protective canopy allows you to experience this power at remarkably close range while remaining safe from the 150-degree water. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/tatsumaki-jigoku/)

The site features a traditional Japanese-style garden with azalea bushes and lush green hillsides that provide a scenic backdrop to the geothermal activity. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298219-d8634576-Reviews-Tatsumaki_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html) During autumn visits in early November, the surrounding vegetation displays seasonal colors that complement the dramatic steam plumes.

## Practical Visiting Tips

**Timing Strategy:**
- Check eruption schedule immediately upon arrival [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html)
- If 20+ minutes until next eruption, visit Chinoike Jigoku first (2 minutes walk)
- Return 5-10 minutes before scheduled eruption to secure good viewing position
- Early morning (8:00-9:00 AM) or late afternoon (4:00-5:00 PM) typically have fewer crowds

**Photography:**
- Front row captures eruption power but may get steam-obscured
- Side angles from terrace benches provide clear sightlines with garden background
- Observatory viewpoint offers elevated perspective (accessible via short trail) [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298219-d8634576-Reviews-Tatsumaki_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)
- Photograph during eruption's peak (2-4 minutes in) for maximum visual impact

**November Visit Advantages:**
- Average temperatures 12-18°C make steam eruptions more visually dramatic
- Cooler weather enhances comfortable viewing conditions
- Autumn foliage provides colorful background
- Falls within Beppu Art Month 2025 (Sept 27 - Nov 16)

**Local Etiquette:**
- Wait quietly during eruption viewing—avoid loud conversations
- Remain seated or in designated viewing areas during eruptions
- Do not attempt to get closer to the geyser vent than protective barriers
- Respect the site's designation as a National Place of Scenic Beauty [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri)
