Kamado Jigoku, or "Cooking Pot Hell," is one of Beppu's seven famous designated Places of Scenic Beauty, unique for featuring six distinct geothermal zones in one location. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_of_Beppu) The site derives its name from an ancient myth in which steamed rice was cooked using the 98Â°C fumarolic gas as an offering to the Ujigami (guardian god) during the Kamado Hachimangu Shrine Festival, highlighting deep connections between the region's powerful geothermal activity and local religious customs. [ðŸ”—](https://kamadojigoku.com/english/)

Historically, the Kannawa area was feared for its intense volcanic activity. According to local legend, the monk Ippen Shonin is credited with "calming the hells" and establishing the foundations for the hot spring resort that exists today, transforming a place of fear into one of healing and community.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

After entering, visitors are greeted by a Japanese demon (oni) statue serving as gatekeeper. According to legend, below the statue is a blue dragon, the god sent to ensure the oni commits no more evil deeds.

The site has gained additional cultural significance through its connection to the popular anime "Demon Slayer," with the main character's name, Kamado Tanjiro, sharing the same "Kamado" designation. This connection has made it particularly popular with anime fans.

## The Kamado Jigoku Experience

### The Six Districts

Kamado Jigoku is unique among the Beppu Hells for featuring six different hot spring sources, each with distinct properties: [ðŸ”—](https://kamadojigoku.com/english/)

**1st District:** A thermal mud hell [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-kamado-jigoku)
