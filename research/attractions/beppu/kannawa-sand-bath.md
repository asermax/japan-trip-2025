Sand bathing (sunayu or sunamushi) is a centuries-old Japanese therapeutic practice that predates written records, with documented observations dating to at least the 16th century when European merchants witnessed the tradition. [ðŸ”—](https://www.traditionalbodywork.com/sand-bathing-japanese-sunaburo-and-sunamushi/) The treatment involves being buried in sand that has been naturally heated by geothermal steam from Beppu's abundant hot springs, creating temperatures between 40-50Â°C (104-122Â°F).

In Beppu's Kannawa district, two primary facilities offer this traditional therapeutic practice: **Hyotan Onsen** (the only Michelin 3-star onsen in Japan) and the historic **Takegawara Onsen** (established 1879). Unlike the beach-based Beppu Kaihin Sunayu which closed in 2023, these inland facilities use geothermal steam to heat their sand, providing a gentler, more controlled experience.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Sand bathing represents one of Japan's oldest therapeutic traditions, with the practice rooted in observations of natural healing occurring at volcanic hot spring beaches. In Kannawa, the practice takes on distinctive characteristics due to the area's intense geothermal activity. Kannawa means "boiling water," and the neighborhood is famous for streets where steam constantly rises from underground vents, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/onsen-hot-springs-and-public-baths/kannawa-onsen-beppu)

The sand used in local facilities comes from Beppu's beaches, composed of fine quartz and coral particles that absorb and retain heat exceptionally well while remaining light and smooth to the touch. Unlike water-based onsen, the weight and heat of the mineral-rich sand create unique therapeutic effects through sustained pressure and gradual deep-tissue warming.

### Hyotan Onsen - Michelin 3-Star Facility

Hyotan Onsen holds the unique distinction of being Japan's only onsen to receive three stars from the Michelin Green Guide, recognizing both its quality and cultural significance. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen) The facility has a 100-year history and uses pure Beppu beach sand heated by natural hot spring steam to a milder temperature than traditional sand baths, allowing guests to enjoy longer sessions without discomfort.
