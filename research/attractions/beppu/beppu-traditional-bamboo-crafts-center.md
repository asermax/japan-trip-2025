The Beppu City Traditional Bamboo Crafts Center (別府市竹細工伝統産業会館) is a cultural facility opened in 1994 to celebrate and preserve a traditional craft with nearly 2,000 years of history. [🔗](https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/see-and-do/spots/beppu-city-traditional-bamboo-crafts-center/) Beppu bamboo craft is the only traditional craft in Oita Prefecture designated by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, earning official recognition in 1979 as a Traditional Japanese Craft. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_bamboo_crafts)

The center serves as both a museum showcasing the evolution of bamboo craft from ancient utilitarian objects to contemporary art pieces, and as a living workshop where visitors can observe artisans at work and participate in hands-on craft experiences. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/717/)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

### Historical Development

Beppu's bamboo crafts trace their origins to the Nara period (8th century), when Emperor Keiko's kitchen staff made a bowl basket from high-quality shinodake bamboo during his visit to Beppu. [🔗](http://oitaisan.com/english/heritage/beppu-bamboo-crafts/) During the Muromachi period (14th-16th centuries), the production of baskets for peddlers and the establishment of the Beppu bamboo craft market led to widespread adoption of bamboo crafting techniques and laid the foundation for the local bamboo craft industry.

As Beppu Onsen became famous throughout Japan during the Edo period, visitors found the baskets and other bamboo products so durable and easy to use that they began taking them home as souvenirs, further invigorating the bamboo craft market and cementing it as a local industry. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/food-and-shopping/beppu-bamboo-craft-history-characteristics-and-a-complete-guide-to-souvenir-shops/)

The connection between Beppu's hot spring culture (particularly the Kannawa district) and bamboo craft is profound. Long-term hot spring visitors used rice sieves and miso strainers produced by local farmers during their stays, creating sustained demand for these practical bamboo items that eventually evolved into refined craft objects. [🔗](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/kannawa-district-beppu-city-oita-prefecture/WQGdiBhkCrg2Iw)

In 1902, the Department of Bamboo Basket Crafts in the Beppu Technical Apprentice School was established, marking the evolution of Beppu bamboo crafts from mere souvenirs to highly skilled craft items. [🔗](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/bepputakezaiku/) In 1967, Shounsai Shono became the first Living National Treasure in bamboo crafts, demonstrating that advanced techniques have been handed down from generation to generation.

### Craftsmanship and Techniques

The hallmark of Beppu bamboo craft is the "weaving" technique (henso), where bamboo strips are woven together by hand using eight basic weaving patterns: Cross Pattern (Yotsume ami), Hexagonal Pattern (Mutsume ami), Octagonal Pattern (Yatsume ami), Netting Pattern (Ajiro ami), Mat Pattern (Gozame ami), Pine Needle Pattern (Matsuba ami), Chrysanthemum Bottom Pattern (Kikuzoko ami), and Bull's Eye Pattern (Rinko ami). These patterns can be combined in over 200 different ways. [🔗](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/bepputakezaiku/)

The production process is meticulous and time-intensive. Quality green bamboo (primarily Madake - Phyllostachys bambusoides) is harvested after three or four years of growing, then cut to size and boiled in water mixed with caustic soda for about fifteen minutes to remove excess oil. After boiling, the bamboo is laid in the sun to dry and turn a beautiful ivory yellow. [🔗](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/traditional-beppu-bamboo-crafts-of-oita-prefecture/)

A tool called a sukisen gives uniform thickness to the strips, and uniform width is achieved by pulling strips between two small blades, with corners rounded off with a chamfer knife. In Beppu, bamboo bark is typically processed until just 0.5 millimeters thick, which is extremely thin and requires considerable skill to achieve. [🔗](https://taimodern.com/article/where-to-find-japans-master-bamboo-weavers/)

The bottom section requires the highest skill level as it is difficult to create a solid body from a flat surface, and for this step, the bamboo is softened over a flame. The body is woven as a continuous piece, with the weaving technique changed or spaced based on the design and purpose. There's a traditional saying: "Three years for splitting, eight years for weaving," meaning that it takes years of training to master the craft. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_bamboo_weaving)

### Regional Context

Oita Prefecture produces approximately 32% of Japan's total Madake supply (as of 2007), making it the nation's top producer. With this abundant resource, bamboo craft has historically flourished in the region. [🔗](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/oita-bamboo-craft-kyoto-women-s-university/8QVBfm9Fcs3hLA?hl=en) The superior craftsmanship and beautiful design of Beppu bamboo crafts have garnered many fans both in Japan and overseas.

The Oita Prefectural Bamboo Craft Training Support Center, established in 1938, is the only publicly funded prefectural-level institution in Japan dedicated to bamboo crafts. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_bamboo_weaving) The center charges minimal fees (students only need to pay for their uniforms and teaching materials), making it accessible compared to private bamboo weaving schools that cost about a million yen per year in tuition. The course is limited to 12 new students per year, maintaining quality and exclusivity.
