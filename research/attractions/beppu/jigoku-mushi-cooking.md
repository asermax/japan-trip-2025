Jigoku-mushi (地獄蒸し, literally "hell steaming") is Beppu's signature culinary experience, a 250-year traditional geothermal steam cooking method documented in the Edo-period text "Tsurumi Shichitouki." [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/stories/jigokumushi) At Jigoku Mushi Kobo Kannawa, visitors experience this sustainable cooking tradition firsthand, using 98°C mineral-rich geothermal steam that naturally enhances flavors with subtle saltiness while requiring no oil or added seasoning. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4707.html) Located in the cultural heart of Kannawa Onsen district, this community facility blends restaurant and public kitchen, staffed by volunteers and operated by Beppu City since 2010 to revive and preserve centuries-old hot spring culture. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4707.html) The practice represents sustainable geothermal cooking using 100% renewable energy with zero carbon footprint, maintaining traditions still used by local residents.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

Jigoku-mushi represents a 250-year culinary tradition documented in "Tsurumi Shichitouki," a historical text from the Edo period depicting traditional cooking methods through pictures and narrative. Originally developed by long-term hot spring therapy patients (湯治客, tōji-kyaku) in Kannawa, the method utilized abundant geothermal steam by laying straw mats over steam vents, pouring water, placing rice mixed with mochi and vegetables, then covering with another mat for steaming. [🔗](https://www.japan-experience.com/plan-your-trip/to-know/japanese-food/jigoku-mushi-cuisine)

The cooking technique reflects Japanese values of sustainability and resourcefulness, using 100% geothermal energy to prepare healthy, additive-free meals. The jigoku-gama (hell ovens) are constructed from stone or brick, sometimes reinforced with concrete, designed to channel geothermal steam from underground hot-spring sources. This gentle cooking method preserves nutrients while naturally infusing food with subtle sodium chloride from the mineral-rich steam.

The Jigoku Mushi Kobo Kannawa facility opened as part of Beppu City's initiative to revive and preserve old hot spring culture for contemporary visitors, maintaining traditional practices while making them accessible to tourists. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4707.html)
