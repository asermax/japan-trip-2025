The arcade includes record shops, cafes, restaurants, variety stores, and grocery stores.

Variety stores stock daily necessities, quirky household items, and affordable gifts. Restaurants range from traditional Japanese cuisine to modern fusion, with many displaying plastic food models (sampuru) showcasing menu options.

Cafes provide rest stops with coffee and light meals, some featuring retro Showa-era dÃ©cor complementing the arcade's 50-year history. Evening hours transform the arcade as izakaya (Japanese pubs) and bars open, creating lively social atmosphere with locals gathering after work.

The Saturday flea market introduces vintage clothing, antiques, crafts, and secondhand treasures, adding treasure-hunting dimension to standard retail browsing. [ðŸ”—](https://www.hotels.com/go/japan/best-places-shopping-beppu)
