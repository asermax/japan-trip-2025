Shiraike Jigoku, established in 1931 when the founder excavated and discovered this hot spring in a field, presents one of the most serene and aesthetically refined experiences among Beppu's seven famous "hells." The name "white pond" describes the water's distinctive appearance—while the spring water gushes out clear at approximately 95°C (203°F), it transforms into a striking milky-white to pale blue color as it enters the pond and the temperature and pressure drop. This unique coloration results from a balanced mixture of boric acid, silicic acid, calcium bicarbonate, and other elements, with non-crystalline silica precipitating as the water cools, creating light-refracting properties that produce the pond's ethereal appearance.

In 2009, Shiraike Jigoku was designated as a national "Place of Scenic Beauty" alongside three other Beppu hells (Umi Jigoku, Chinoike Jigoku, and Tatsumaki Jigoku). This designation recognizes not just the pond itself but the entire landscape composition—the harmonious integration of the "hellish" natural phenomenon with the serene, traditional Japanese garden surrounding it.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

In Japanese hot spring culture, the term *jigoku* (地獄, "hell") refers specifically to hot springs that are for viewing rather than bathing. Their dramatic appearance—with boiling water, vibrant colors, and steam erupting from the ground—evoked images of Buddhist hells in the minds of ancient peoples. The *Bungo Fudoki*, an 8th-century historical record, mentions that the steaming, boiling lands of Beppu were considered the domain of powerful local gods, too dangerous for humans to approach. [🔗](https://gemini-research-2025-09-30)

The broader narrative of Beppu involves the Buddhist monk Ippen Shonin, who is credited with developing the onsen for therapeutic use, representing a cultural shift from fearing geothermal power to harnessing its benevolent aspects. A statue of Ippen Shonin has been erected at Shiraike Jigoku, honoring his role in creating Kannawa as a hot spring town. [🔗](https://gemini-research-2025-09-30)

The site houses prefecturally designated "tangible cultural properties," including the Kunisaki Tower and Nihou Nanga-do, which exhibits Oita-related local art and paintings, adding layers of cultural heritage beyond the natural hot spring phenomenon.

## The Shiraike Jigoku Experience

### The Distinctive Milky Waters

Unlike the vibrant cobalt blue of Umi Jigoku or the blood-red of Chinoike Jigoku, Shiraike Jigoku presents a more subtle, ethereal beauty. The pond's color shifts depending on sunlight, weather conditions, and viewing angle—ranging from pale milky-white to light blue with a gentle, otherworldly glow. This changing appearance adds an element of natural mystery that captivates visitors throughout the day. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-shiraike-jigoku)

### The Traditional Garden Setting

The pond is surrounded by a meticulously maintained circular Japanese garden that creates a peaceful, contemplative atmosphere. This is the most serene of Beppu's hells—less about dramatic heat and steam, more about refined beauty and the harmonious integration of natural and cultivated elements. The garden's design exemplifies traditional *wafu* aesthetics, with carefully placed plantings and viewing perspectives that frame the white pond as the central focal point. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/shiraike-jigoku/)

In November, the garden's autumn foliage provides a stunning contrast to the milky-white water, creating exceptional photography opportunities. The combination of red and yellow autumn leaves, green bamboo groves, and the pale pond creates a multi-layered composition unique among the seven hells.

### The Tropical Fish Museum

The on-site aquarium offers an unexpected counterpoint to the hot spring viewing. Seeing massive pirarucu and fearsome piranhas thriving in water heated by the earth's geothermal power creates a fascinating connection between distant Amazonian ecosystems and Japanese volcanic geology. For many visitors, this quirky addition represents the creative, slightly whimsical character of Showa-era Japanese tourism attractions.

The facility uses geothermal heat to maintain aquarium water temperatures between 26-30°C year-round, making it the only aquarium in Japan that uses hot spring steam for heating. The museum houses approximately 16 species of freshwater fish. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/shiraike-jigoku/)

*Note:* Some recent visitor reviews express concerns about the aquarium's maintenance and conditions. [🔗](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298219-d10793183-Reviews-Shiraike_Jigoku-Beppu_Oita_Prefecture_Kyushu.html)

### Cultural Property Exhibits

The Nihou Nanga-do exhibition space displays Oita-related local art and paintings, providing cultural context beyond the natural hot spring phenomenon. The Kunisaki Tower adds architectural interest to the site. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/shiraike-jigoku/)

### Ippen Shonin Memorial

The statue honoring Ippen Shonin connects the site to Beppu's broader spiritual and cultural history, representing the transformation of fearsome geothermal phenomena into spaces of human benefit and contemplation. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/shiraike-jigoku/)

This approach provides gentle exercise while experiencing the gradual transition between different geothermal phenomena. [🔗](https://oita-tourism.com/en/onsenStories/jigokumeguri)

**Cultural Etiquette:**
- Understand that jigoku are fundamentally different from onsen—they are for viewing and contemplation, not bathing
- Water temperature (95°C/203°F) is dangerously hot—respect barriers and viewing areas
- Garden designed for quiet, contemplative viewing—walk slowly and appreciate the harmony [🔗](https://gemini-research-2025-09-30)

**November Essentials:**
- Layered clothing (temperatures range 10-18°C)
- Light jacket for evening and early morning

**Visitor Expectations:**
Shiraike Jigoku is the most peaceful and subdued of the seven hells. Visitors expecting dramatic geothermal displays may find it less impressive than Umi Jigoku or Chinoike Jigoku. However, its refined beauty, traditional garden setting, and national scenic beauty designation reflect a different aesthetic value—the harmonious integration of natural phenomenon and cultivated landscape.
