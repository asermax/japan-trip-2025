Mount Tsurumi (é¶´è¦‹å²³, Tsurumi-dake) is a 1,374.5-meter active volcano that dominates the western skyline of Beppu, serving as both a sacred mountain and one of Kyushu's most accessible panoramic viewpoints. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tsurumi) The mountain's volcanic nature is intrinsically linked to Beppu's renowned geothermal system - the Beppu geothermal area is centered beneath Mount Tsurumi and the adjacent Garandake volcano at the northern end of the Ryukyu volcanic arc. [ðŸ”—](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=282130)

This volcanic complex produces the extraordinary geothermal output that powers Beppu's 2,000+ hot springs, with fumarolic and hot spring activity spreading from the Tsurumi volcanic group down to Beppu's eastern coast over a 5km by 8km range, generating approximately 50,000 tons of hot spring water daily and 350 MW of thermal energy. [ðŸ”—](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375650589901041)

The Beppu Ropeway, opened in 1962, provides dramatic access to this volcanic landscape. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Ropeway) As Kyushu's largest cable car with a maximum capacity of 101 passengers, it ascends nearly 800 meters up the steep volcanic slopes in just 10 minutes, reaching an altitude of 1,300 meters above sea level. [ðŸ”—](https://www.beppu-ropeway.co.jp/en/)

CNN recognized the ropeway's panoramic vistas by naming it one of "Japan's 34 most stunning views." [ðŸ”—](https://www.beppu-ropeway.co.jp/en/) From the upper station and surrounding observation decks, visitors encounter breathtaking 360-degree views encompassing Beppu and Oita City, the azure waters of Beppu Bay, the distinctive cone of Mount Yufu to the west, and the dramatic peaks of the Kuju Mountains extending toward the horizon on clear days. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4706.html)

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The mountain has been an object of religious devotion for centuries, featuring the Tsurumi Sanjo Gongen Ichinomiya Shrine at its summit along with statues of the Seven Gods of Fortune (shichi-fuku-jin) and stone representations of both Buddhist and Shinto deities, reflecting the syncretic nature of Japanese mountain worship. [ðŸ”—](https://hikesinjapan.yamakei-online.com/course/106.php) This sacred character places Mount Tsurumi within Japan's broader tradition of mountains as liminal spaces where the physical and spiritual worlds intersect.

Geologically, Mount Tsurumi is classified as an andesitic-to-dacitic lava dome, with its most recent eruption occurring in 867 CE through explosive activity from the summit area. [ðŸ”—](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=282130) The mountain's volcanic composition and activity postdate the 6,300-year-old Akahoya ash from Kikai volcano, with earlier eruptions dominated by pyroclastic flows while more recent activity has produced lava domes and flows.

## Integration with Beppu Attractions

**Relationship to Kannawa Onsen District:**
Mount Tsurumi forms part of the volcanic system that generates Kannawa's abundant geothermal activity. The mountain is visible from many points in Kannawa district, and fumarolic activity extends from the Tsurumi volcanic group down toward the eastern coast where Kannawa is located. [ðŸ”—](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375650589901041) Visiting the ropeway provides geographic context for understanding Beppu's extraordinary onsen resources.

**Connection to Beppu Geothermal System:**
The views from Mount Tsurumi's observation decks reveal the full extent of Beppu's geothermal activity, with countless steam plumes rising from the city's 2,000+ hot springs visible from above. This aerial perspective demonstrates the remarkable scale of the volcanic system that produces approximately 350 MW of thermal energy and 50,000 tons of hot spring water daily.
