Yufuin is an upscale hot spring resort town located at the base of Mount Yufu (1,583.3m), a distinctive twin-peaked volcano. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4750.html) Unlike nearby Beppu's urban, commercial atmosphere, Yufuin deliberately maintained a smaller, quieter, and more peaceful character focused on preserving natural beauty and landscapes. [ðŸ”—](https://whereandwander.com/beppu-or-yufuin-or-kurokawa-best-onsen-base/)

The town features boutique shopping streets, art galleries, scenic lakeside walks, and high-quality dining experiences.

## Cultural & Atmospheric Significance

Yufuin offers a distinctly different experience from Beppu. While Beppu is a city of 110,000 that "happens to get a ton of onsen," Yufuin is described as a more tranquil and rustic alternative with a less commercial feel. [ðŸ”—](https://whereandwander.com/beppu-or-yufuin-or-kurokawa-best-onsen-base/) The main street is lined with cafes, boutiques, and small museums, creating an atmosphere more like a trendy shopping area than a typical onsen town. [ðŸ”—](https://whereandwander.com/beppu-or-yufuin-or-kurokawa-best-onsen-base/)

What really sets Yufuin apart is its wide range of art galleries and museums, from high-brow contemporary art to folk crafts. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/beppu/museums-galleries/yufuin-museums) The scenic 800-meter-long Yunotsubo Kaido street connects JR Yufuin Station to Lake Kinrinko, featuring over 50 establishments selling local specialties, restaurants serving Oita cuisine, and craft shopsâ€”all with Mount Yufu's dramatic twin peaks as a backdrop.
