Okamotoya Shop stands as Beppu's most famous destination for jigoku-mushi (hell-steamed) pudding and authentic yunohana products, operating since 1988 in the Myoban hot spring district. [ðŸ”—](https://jigoku-prin.com/en/) Located at 3 Kumi, Myoban, with panoramic views toward Beppu Bay and surrounded by traditional yunohana-goya straw huts, the shop represents the intersection of Beppu's hot spring culture and culinary innovation.

## Cultural & Culinary Significance

Okamotoya achieved fame through repeated research creating the "Original Beppu Special Jigoku-mushi Pudding," a unique dessert that has maintained its original recipe since debut in 1988. [ðŸ”—](https://jigoku-prin.com/en/) The pudding derives its distinctive character from being steamed in extremely hot sulfur-laden vapor erupting from underground hot springs - the naturally occurring sulfur acts as a preservative while creating the pudding's signature mineral flavor and exquisitely soft texture.

The shop uses luxurious amounts of fresh eggs, milk, and cream, crafting each pudding carefully by hand with no artificial preservatives. [ðŸ”—](https://jigoku-prin.com/en/) The result is a well-balanced dessert that avoids excessive sweetness while achieving both firmness and exquisite softness through the unique hell-steaming process. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/okamotoya-shop-savor-handmade-jigokumushi-pudding-beppus-iconic-sweet-treat-steamed-in-hot-springs/) The slightly bitter caramel complements the rich, creamy custard, while the mineral taste from hot spring-steamed eggs creates a unique flavor profile impossible to replicate elsewhere.

Beyond pudding, the shop sells natural bathwater additives called "Yunohana" harvested in the traditional yunohana-goya huts visible throughout the property. These 100% natural bathing powders are created when steam erupting from underground permeates blue clay-covered floors, with yunohana crystals separating from the clay surface after approximately one month. This production method has been designated an important intangible folk culture asset by the Japanese government. [ðŸ”—](https://www.okamotoya.net/en/shop/)
