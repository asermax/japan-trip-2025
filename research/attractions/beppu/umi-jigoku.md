Umi Jigoku, the "Sea Hell," is the largest and most famous of Beppu's seven hells, featuring a stunning cobalt-blue geothermal pool reaching 98Â°C (208Â°F) and descending 200 meters deep. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-umi-jigoku) Created approximately 1,200 years ago during Mount Tsurumi's 867 CE volcanic eruption, the explosion blasted open new hydrothermal vents that continue channeling superheated fluids from a 250-300Â°C deep reservoir beneath Beppu's volcanic system. [ðŸ”—](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=282130) [ðŸ”—](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375650589901041) The site represents one of Japan's most dramatic displays of geothermal activity, designated as a National Place of Scenic Beauty. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/713/)

The earliest written record appears in the eighth-century Bungo no kuni fudoki (Record of Bungo Province), describing these sites as cursed lands where animals disappeared into bubbling pits. [ðŸ”—](https://unseen-japan.com/jigokudani-hell-valleys-japan/) During the Edo period, the traveler Furukawa Koshoken documented it in 1783 as "Ike no Jigoku" (Pond's Hell). [ðŸ”—](https://www.mlit.go.jp/tagengo-db/en/R2-02059.html) For over 1,000 years, these sites were feared as manifestations of Buddhist hell concepts. Buddhist monk Ippen Shonin's legendary 1276 interventionâ€”casting stones inscribed with sutras into boiling pools to "tame the hells"â€”transformed these feared sites into healing sanctuaries by establishing the first therapeutic mushiyu steam baths.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The term "jigoku" derives from the Buddhist concept of Ennetsu-jigoku (burning hell), reflecting ancient fears of these powerful geothermal sites. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html) The formal "Beppu Jigoku Meguri" (Hell Tour) was officially organized as a sightseeing course in 1924, transforming once-feared sites into celebrated attractions while preserving their connection to Buddhist concepts and local traditions. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mlit.go.jp/tagengo-db/en/R2-02057.html)

Traditional cooking method "jigoku mushi" (hell steaming) dates back to the Edo period. Historical records from 250 years ago describe laying straw mats over steam vents to cook rice, mochi, potatoes, and red beans. [ðŸ”—](https://oita-tourism.com/en/stories/jigokumushi) Before tourism, the jigoku served practical purposes for the local community through this traditional steam cooking.

## The Umi Jigoku Experience

### The Cobalt Blue Mystery

Umi Jigoku's name comes from its striking cobalt-blue color resembling the sea, though at 98Â°C it's decidedly unbathable. The vivid blue results from high levels of iron sulfate naturally dissolved in the water, combined with silica crystals that scatter only blue wavelengths of lightâ€”a completely natural phenomenon requiring no artificial coloring. [ðŸ”—](https://www.mytravelbuzzg.com/umi-jigoku-beppu/) The spring constantly produces dramatic plumes of steam, particularly striking against cooler autumn air in early November.

### Main Attractions

**The Cobalt Blue Pool:** The centerpiece features the 200-meter-deep boiling pool with mesmerizing turquoise-blue waters constantly shrouded in steam. Multiple viewing points include ground-level observation areas and an elevated deck in the museum building providing bird's-eye views. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/umijigoku-2/)

**Japanese Garden:** Beautifully manicured traditional gardens surround the hot spring, featuring azalea plantings, a tranquil fish pond, colorful seasonal flowers, and traditional Japanese landscaping. November visits coincide with peak autumn foliage, displaying vibrant reds and golds.

**Tropical Greenhouse:** A large glass greenhouse uses natural geothermal heat to cultivate Amazonian plants, including spectacular Victoria amazonica (royal water lilies). From May through early November, the massive lily pads grow 1-2 meters wideâ€”so strong that small children (up to 20 kg) can stand on them. [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/umijigoku-2/)

**Shinto Shrine (Yakushido):** Traditional red torii arches and a small shrine dedicated to Yakushi Nyorai (Buddha of Healing and Medicine) grace the grounds, reflecting the site's spiritual significance and the Buddhist concept of healing associated with hot springs.
