Hyotan Onsen stands as Beppu's most prestigious onsen facility, earning the distinction of being Japan's only three Michelin-star hot springâ€”an achievement maintained for seven consecutive years. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen) Founded in 1922 by Junsaku, who originally dug the onsen to help heal his wife's rheumatism, the facility takes its name from the gourd-shaped (hyotan) stone bath, inspired by samurai leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi's legendary war councils held in gourd-shaped baths. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen)

Located at the gateway of Kannawa district on Yukemuri Road, Hyotan Onsen offers 100% natural, free-flowing hot spring water from Beppu's abundant geothermal resources. [ðŸ”—](https://www.hyotan-onsen.com/english/) The facility developed its own innovative bamboo cooling system to regulate water temperature from the source's 100Â°C down to a comfortable 45Â°C for bathing. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen)

What sets Hyotan Onsen apart is its comprehensive approach to traditional onsen culture while remaining exceptionally welcoming to international visitors. Unlike many traditional onsen, Hyotan has been tattoo-friendly since its inception, and recently began offering halal food options to accommodate the growing Islamic community and Southeast Asian visitors.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

The facility underwent renovations while maintaining its traditional character, now offering an impressive variety of bathing experiences: multiple indoor baths, outdoor rotenburo (open-air baths), waterfall massage baths (utase-yu), steam baths (mushiyu), sand baths (sunayu), and 14 private family baths. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen) This combination of traditional authenticity, therapeutic variety, and international accessibility explains why it has become one of Beppu's most beloved onsen facilities for both locals and travelers.

The facility's innovative bamboo cooling system represents a unique engineering solution to managing extremely hot geothermal water, demonstrating the creativity applied to traditional onsen culture. [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyotan_Onsen)
