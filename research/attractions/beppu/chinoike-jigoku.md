Chinoike Jigoku (血の池地獄, literally "Blood Pond Hell") holds the distinction of being Japan's oldest natural hot spring hell, with a documented history spanning over 1,300 years. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-chinoike-jigoku) The site is recorded as "Akayu-sen" (Red Hot Spring) in the Bungo no Kuni Fudoki, a historical record compiled during the Nara period more than 1,300 years ago. [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chinoike-jigoku)

In 2009, Chinoike Jigoku was designated as one of Japan's National Places of Scenic Beauty alongside three other hells in Beppu, recognizing its geological and cultural importance. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-chinoike-jigoku) The site stretches approximately 1,300 square meters and has evolved from a natural geothermal phenomenon into a well-maintained tourist attraction.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

The striking appearance results from fascinating natural chemical processes. The pond maintains a constant temperature of approximately 78°C (172°F), with boiling bubbles and steam wafting continuously from its surface. [🔗](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chinoike-jigoku) While the hot spring water itself is clear, the bottom sediment contains high concentrations of iron oxide and magnesium oxide, produced by natural chemical reactions between extreme water temperatures and underground geological pressure. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/chinoike-jigoku/) This iron-rich clay gives the entire pond its dramatic deep red to orange hue, creating the appearance that inspired its evocative name. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-chinoike-jigoku)

### Medicinal Heritage

For centuries, the red clay from Chinoike Jigoku has been valued for its medicinal properties. The iron-rich sediment was traditionally used to dye fabrics and, more importantly, to create healing ointments for treating skin conditions. [🔗](https://www.japan-suki.com/en/visit/places/beppu-chinoike-jigoku)

The famous "Chinoike Ointment" (Blood Pond Ointment or "Chinoikenanko") has a documented history dating back to the Meiji era (1868-1912), when the ointment was stored and sold in shells. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/chinoikejigoku/) This traditional skin remedy became known for its effectiveness in treating burns, frostbite, cracked skin, and various dermatological conditions, with magnesium sulfate serving as a key therapeutic component. [🔗](https://www.mytravelbuzzg.com/chinoike-jigoku-beppu/)

Today, many locals in Oita Prefecture continue to trust this generational product, and visitors can purchase the ointment as a unique souvenir exclusively available at the site. [🔗](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/sightseeing/chinoikejigoku/)
