*Beppu Tower, a 100-meter National Tangible Cultural Property completed in 1957, stands as the iconic symbol of central Beppu*

Central Beppu is the vibrant heart of the city, combining modern shopping facilities with retro Showa-era charm. The district centers around Beppu Station and extends to the Kitahama waterfront area (5-10 minutes on foot), featuring the iconic Beppu Tower, covered shopping arcades, diverse dining options, and lively nightlife venues. [🔗](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4705.html) This highly walkable urban core blends nostalgic Japanese shotengai culture with contemporary amenities, providing comprehensive shopping, dining, and cultural experiences.

**Beppu Tower** dominates the district - a 100-meter-tall lattice structure completed in May 1957 and designed by renowned architect Tachū Naitō, who also created Tokyo Tower and Tsutenkaku. As the third TV tower built in Japan and one of the "Six Tower Brothers," Beppu Tower achieved National Tangible Cultural Property status in October 2007. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppu_Tower) [🔗](https://bepputower.co.jp/en/about/) The tower underwent major renovation in 2023, restoring it to its original 100-meter height.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Central Beppu represents the evolution of Japanese urban commercial culture from the Showa era (1926-1989) through to the present day. The shopping arcades preserve traditional shotengai (shopping street) culture - covered pedestrian streets that historically formed the commercial hearts of Japanese cities. [🔗](https://www.trip.com/moments/theme/destination-beppu-57513-shopping-993139/)

**Beppu Station Market**, built under the elevated station, showcases authentic daily life tied to local commerce - pharmacies, confectionary shops, and fresh food vendors serving neighborhood residents for decades. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-t9721/)

**Kitakoka Shotengai Shopping Street**, built around 50 years ago, exemplifies the "under the train shops" arcade phenomenon - commercial spaces integrated into railway infrastructure. Recent revitalization has attracted modern cafes and select shops while preserving the Heisei-era character, demonstrating adaptive reuse of mid-20th century urban architecture. [🔗](https://www.trip.com/moments/theme/destination-beppu-57513-shopping-993139/) [🔗](https://sugoii-japan.com/best-things-to-do-in-beppu)

**Sol Paseo Ginza** and the **Motomachi entertainment district** preserve traditional Japanese izakaya culture - small neighborhood pubs serving local cuisine with sake and beer, fostering community connections through food and drink. This nightlife zone maintains authentic Japanese urban entertainment traditions distinct from tourist-oriented venues. [🔗](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJtrv1025-en/)
