Takegawara Onsen stands as a living monument to Japanese bathing culture, originally constructed in 1879 during the Meiji Period and comprehensively renovated in 1938 to incorporate the shrine-like facade it maintains today. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/389/) The name "Takegawara" (bamboo tile) derives from the original roof material - bamboo instead of traditional tiles - though the present building features a distinctive Chinese-style luxurious gabled roof called "karahafu," a design peculiar to Japanese temple and shrine architecture.

The bathhouse is a remarkable two-story wooden structure spreading over 906 square meters, with heavy, thick timber construction that has earned it designation as a Tangible Cultural Property of Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tattoofriendlyonsen.com/onsen/takegawara-onsen) Its traditional structure, reminiscent of a shrine, makes it a rarity in modern Japan, evoking comparisons to the famous Dogo Onsen and the atmospheric bathhouse from Studio Ghibli's "Spirited Away."

## Cultural & Historical Significance

What truly distinguishes Takegawara Onsen is its unique indoor sand bath (sunamushi) - the only one of its kind in Beppu. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/5326) The sand is geothermally heated by hot spring water flowing beneath it, creating a natural sauna that reaches approximately 50Â°C. [ðŸ”—](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/389/) This traditional therapy promotes deep detoxification, relieves joint pain and neuralgia, improves circulation, and aids with digestive problems, stiffness, and sensitivity to cold as mineral-rich heat penetrates deep into muscles. [ðŸ”—](https://www.tattoofriendlyonsen.com/onsen/takegawara-onsen) [ðŸ”—](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/12822/)

Historically, the facility attracted many patients seeking treatment for rheumatism and neuralgia, and legend tells of patients leaving a mountain of crutches in front of a healing Buddha statue, no longer needing them after bathing in the therapeutic waters. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/5326)

The interior features a high-ceilinged lobby where guests can relax after bathing, with architecture reminiscent of the early Showa period (1930s), creating an atmospheric journey back to traditional Japan. [ðŸ”—](https://matcha-jp.com/en/5139)

## The Sand Bath Experience (Sunamushi)

The signature experience follows a unique traditional process:

1. **Purchase ticket** at reception (Â¥1,500) and receive yukata rental
2. **Change into yukata** with nothing underneath. Important: left side on top (right side on top is traditionally associated with the deceased). Tie up long hair or use shower caps to keep sand out. [ðŸ”—](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/takegawara-onsen/)
3. **Enter sand bath room** and follow staff instructions to lie face-up on the hot sand [ðŸ”—](https://enjoyonsen.city.beppu-jp.com/onsen/takegawaraonsen/)

5. **Relax for 10-15 minutes** experiencing the pleasant warmth and pressure. The sand is quite heavy and you'll be fairly immobilized. Many visitors fall asleep during this deeply relaxing experience. [ðŸ”—](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/takegawara-onsen/)
6. **After burial ends**, place sand-covered yukata in basket - staff will collect it later [ðŸ”—](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/takegawara-onsen/)
7. **Shower thoroughly** to wash away all sand
8. **Enjoy regular onsen baths** to complete your experience (optional but recommended)

**Unique Feature:** The sand bath is a co-ed communal experience where both male and female visitors use the same facility while wearing yukata, making it unusual among Japanese bathing traditions. [ðŸ”—](https://travel.gaijinpot.com/takegawara-onsen/)
