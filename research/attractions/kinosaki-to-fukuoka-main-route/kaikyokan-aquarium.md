The Shimonoseki Marine Science Museum "Kaikyokan" (海響館) stands as one of western Japan's premier marine educational facilities, strategically positioned along the Kanmon Straits at the westernmost point of Honshu. [🔗](https://www.setouchi.travel/en/trip-ideas/6759/) The name "Kaikyokan" translates to "Ocean Straits Museum," reflecting its location overlooking the narrow 650-meter waterway separating Honshu and Kyushu. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanmon_Straits)

The aquarium's central mission celebrates Shimonoseki's unique maritime heritage as Japan's undisputed fugu (pufferfish) capital. Four out of five fugu caught in Japan pass through Shimonoseki's wholesale markets. [🔗](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/pufferfish-fugu-capital-shimonoseki-japan/index.html) The aquarium features the world's largest collection of pufferfish species on public display, showcasing over 100 varieties from around the globe in its specialized "Fugupedia" corner. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/directory/item/15464/)

Beyond pufferfish, Kaikyokan houses approximately 500 marine species, with exhibits designed to showcase the unique ecosystem of the Kanmon Straits. Additional highlights include daily dolphin and sea lion shows, an underwater tunnel walkway, and a complete blue whale skeleton. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/175/)

**CRITICAL OPERATIONAL NOTE:** The aquarium closed for renovations on December 1, 2024, with a scheduled reopening in summer 2025. [🔗](https://japankuru.medium.com/the-loneliest-sunfish-in-japan-is-waiting-for-visitors-at-the-shimonoseki-aquarium-d05f1555ad8a) The October 30, 2025 travel date should fall after reopening, but **confirmation is mandatory before planning a detour**.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Shimonoseki's connection to pufferfish extends back millennia—archaeological evidence from kaizuka (ancient trash dumps) reveals that fugu bones date back at least 2,800 years. [🔗](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/pufferfish-fugu-capital-shimonoseki-japan/index.html)

The modern fugu culture in Shimonoseki has a fascinating origin story. When Itō Hirobumi, Japan's first Prime Minister, tasted properly prepared fugu during a visit, he enjoyed it so much that he lifted the centuries-old ban on eating fugu in 1888—with Shimonoseki becoming the first city in Japan to legally serve it. [🔗](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/the-history-behind-fugu-cuisine-and-different-delicious-ways-to-eat-fugu)

In Shimonoseki, locals don't call the fish "fugu"—they use the term "fuku," a deliberate homophone meaning "fortune" or "good luck" in Japanese, treating this fish as a symbol of prosperity. [🔗](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/pufferfish-fugu-capital-shimonoseki-japan/index.html)

The Kanmon Straits holds immense strategic value. With a width of only 650 meters, this waterway has long served as a critical maritime chokepoint on the sea route connecting the Asian continent with Kyushu and Kansai regions. [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanmon_Straits) This location witnessed the decisive Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185, considered Japan's first large-scale civil war during the Genpei conflict. [🔗](https://www.britannica.com/place/Shimonoseki)

Kaikyokan serves an important educational role in marine science, showcasing the unique biodiversity of the Kanmon Straits ecosystem while promoting understanding of marine conservation. [🔗](https://www.setouchi.travel/en/trip-ideas/6759/)
