Michi-no-Eki (道の駅, literally "road station") are government-designated rest areas along major highways and local roads in Japan, providing essential services for long-distance drivers. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/michi-no-eki/) As of January 2025, there are 1,230 roadside stations across Japan's 47 prefectures. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/article/item/20932/)

For the Kinosaki to Itoshima route via Chugoku and Kyushu Expressways (approximately 568 km, 7-8 hours base drive time), these roadside stations serve dual purposes: practical rest stops with 24-hour facilities and cultural gateways to regional specialties and local products. [🔗](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/michi-no-eki/)

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Michi-no-Eki roadside stations represent a uniquely Japanese approach to highway infrastructure, combining practical rest stop services with cultural tourism and regional economic development. To register with the government as a Michi-no-Eki, facilities must provide three essential functions: free 24-hour parking, free 24-hour rest facilities (restrooms), and information services. [🔗](https://japantravelplanning.com/michi-no-eki/)

Beyond these basic requirements, most stations feature farmers markets selling locally grown agricultural products, livestock, and seafood, along with restaurants serving regional delicacies and shops offering artisanal processed goods made from regional ingredients. [🔗](https://www.gltjp.com/en/article/item/20932/)

**Important Distinction:** Michi-no-Eki are located along national highways and general roads, not directly on expressways. Expressways feature Service Areas (SA) and Parking Areas (PA) instead. For roadside stations, drivers must exit the expressway at designated interchanges. [🔗](https://fukuokaeats.com/eats/fukuoka-specialties/)
