The Kinosaki to Itoshima route utilizes Japan's expressway network via Chugoku Expressway westbound (568 km total) followed by Kyushu Expressway southbound after crossing the iconic Kanmon Bridge.

Japanese expressway service areas (SA) and parking areas (PA) have evolved from simple rest stops into retail, cuisine, and entertainment complexes where travelers can dine on local delicacies and browse markets for regional produce.
